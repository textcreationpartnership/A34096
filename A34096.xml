            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

<pb facs="tcp:44083:19"/> of making this book ſpeak Engliſh, is not to carry on any deſign, to ſmooth or pleaſe any party, but to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance the common intereſt of Chriſtians in promoting the union of the Churches (all but one) which this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe ſhews how it may be rendred practicable; if men would a little unhusk themſelves of their own ſingula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities, diveſt themſelves of thoſe prejudices they have entertained, and minde the things that tend to peace and edification. The firſt motion to the ſaid tranſlati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, was from a Reverend Brother, whoſe travels in the work of Pacification, the following ages will more grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully acknowledge, then the preſent. The Tranſlator thinks himſelf ſufficiently rewarded, with thine and his own edification, in the aſſured knowledge of ſome mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentous matters which are herein contained and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated; which are as followeth,</p>
            <p n="1">
               <hi>1.</hi> That there have been, and are ſome in the world, that do evince to all men, that the Goſpel is not a Fable, but that the truths thereof do make real impreſſions, and work ſtrange changes upon the mindes and conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations of men; and that the Diſcipline of the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, where but ſo much of it is practiced as is owned by all Chriſtians, hath that majeſtie and power with it, that it needs not the whole ſecular arm to uphold it, nor fears the ſame power, though it be againſt it: for the Church had never better Paſtors and Government, then in Perſecution; nor ever thrives better, then when its Paſtors do wholly attend their flocks, and retrench themſelves from Secularities, and Courtly concernments, to minde the good of ſouls, the rebuking and ſuppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of wickedneſs, Hereſie, Errors, Schiſms, advancing Piety and Godlineſs in the ſtrict obſervation of the Lords-Day, expreſſing more zeal againſt the Prophaners
<pb facs="tcp:44083:19"/> of the Lords name, and thoſe that live ſo unlike Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians in the world. I am but an obſcure perſon in the world, I dare preſume to ſay, that this way to proſperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and eſtabliſhment will never fail; but I do verily believe, that there are not greater enemies in the world to Epiſcopacy, then ſome Biſhops; and that the ready way to throw it down, is to ſet themſelves up, with the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munire of their <hi>Jus Divinum,</hi> and Secular Domination.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <hi>2.</hi> That it is poſſible to maintain Order and Decency in the Church, and diſparity among Miniſters, without a rigorous impoſing of Ceremonies and Forms, or ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing Biſhops into Superior Order above Presbyters: Let but Ceremonies keep their proper place and ſtation, and be looked upon as things indifferent, and the uſe of them left free to Chriſtians, we need have no more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt about them: If it appear by experience in them that uſe them, that they do really tend to Edification and Charity (as they muſt, or elſe they are nullities and mockeries) the greateſt part, I believe, of Miniſters and Chriſtians in <hi>England</hi> will take them up (nor yet are we ſure that even in Heaven we ſhall be all of one ſize or poſture) if there be ſuch excellency, ſignificancy and teachableneſs in them, and yet no Superſtition: Let them ſtand a while without the bolſter of penal Statutes, and let us ſee what ground they get: For if this were done, that Miniſters might uſe them, or not, as they finde them moſt convenient in times and places, poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly many, if not all Miniſters, might ſometime uſe them. For ſuppoſe that a Miniſter were to preach at the Court, ſome Cathedral or Oratory, that were trained up to theſe things, prudence would direct him, upon ſuch an occaſion, and for that inſtant, to do many things which he doth not do in his own, or in an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
<pb facs="tcp:44083:20"/> Congregation; as in <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſity he would uſe an hood, which it were ridiculous for him to do at home: So if a Biſhop were to preach in an ordinary particular Congregation or charge, where the people were wholly ſtrangers to the uſages or forms of the Court, Colledge or Cathedral, if he came in the ordinary garb of the Miniſter of the place, and preached in the ordinary mode of a countrey Miniſter, I believe it would get him more reverence and eſteem in the hearts of the people, and tend more to unity and edification, then if he ſhould come in his (Pontifical) formal Proceſſion, with a pompous train of attendants; <hi>For the Apoſtle be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came a Jew to them that were Jews, that he might gain the Jews; and a Gentile, to them that were Gentiles, &amp;c.</hi> that is, in indifferent things; for we abhor to think, that he would transform himſelf into more Religions in any reſpect whatſoever. To this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, <hi>Auguſtine</hi> tells us, <hi>That he knew no better courſe for a ſerious, prudent Chriſtian to take in matters of Ceremonies, or Cuſtom, then to follow the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the Church where he is; for whatſoever is there obſerved, neither againſt faith nor manners, is a matter of it ſelf indifferent, and to be obſerved according to the cuſtom of thoſe with whom we live.</hi> This was <hi>Ambroſes</hi> counſel, I think, to <hi>Monica, Auguſtines</hi> Mother, <hi>When I am at</hi> Rome (ſaith he) <hi>I faſt on the Sabbath day; but at</hi> Millain <hi>I do not; ſo do you likewiſe, when you come to any Church, obſerve its cuſtom, if you would not be offenſive to them, nor have them ſo to you:</hi> Which judgement of <hi>Ambroſe, Auguſtine</hi> ſaith, he always looked on <hi>Tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam coeleſte Oraculum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As for the ſtate and pomp of that pretended Order,
<pb facs="tcp:44083:20"/> which is as the <hi>Alder</hi> in our Garden, I'll tell you a ſtory; There was a Garriſon of Souldiers, and divers Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders over them; amongſt the reſt, there was one a true Veteran, that had been trained up in the School of War, under moſt of the Princes of Chriſtendom: This Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, inſtead of thoſe ſoft delights other Gentlemen and Commanders waſted their time in, ſpent his inconverſing with, and training his Souldiers, would be upon the Guard when his turn came himſelf, no weather could prevent it; his houſe inſtead of being furniſhed with ſilken beds, rare looking-glaſſes, curious pictures, was ſtored with barrels of meal, rice, peaſe, ſo placed low, that they ſerved inſtead of chairs and ſtools, his rooms hung with flitches and gammons of <hi>Weſtphaly</hi> bacon, dried beef, fiſh, &amp;c. materials with which he kept a conſtant table, and welcomed all his Souldiers: in the Sum, was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways in fight or ſervice, and he had theſe Souldiers cloſe to him, they would go through fire and water with him: what men ſoever failed of their duty, his never did, but were all of a knot, and unanimous in their atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance upon him in any ſervice. I'll only apply it thus, that would our reverend Fathers of the Church be more up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the guard themſelves, be employed in the Churches duty, and not commit that Soleciſm in Government (which the learned <hi>Bacon</hi> thinks one of the <hi>inſolubilia</hi>) to do their work by deputation (of a Chancellor;) would they inſtead of keeping diſtance, converſe more famili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arly with their flocks, and ſtep in now and then to a Countrey Miniſter on a ſudden, whom it may be they may finde ſtanding ſentinel, and encourage him in his duty; would they inſtead of giving and forcing on the people Quelchechoſes of Forms and Ceremonies, give them ſolid meat and nouriſhment, the pure Word of God, in
<pb facs="tcp:44083:21"/> the inſtitutions of Chriſt; ſuffer that only to be read, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punded, urged in the Church; would they inſtead of making their houſes Lordly Courts to fright poor people and Miniſters from coming at them, make them Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories for Prayer, and expounding Scripture of Gods inſtitution, ſetting up catechiſtical and expoſitory Lectures ſo many days in the week, either by themſelves or their Chaplains, or calling in the aſſiſtance of ſome learned and pious Presbyters; would they enquire in their Viſitations after prophaneneſs, and cenſure that more deeply, then ſome have done non-conformity to ſelf-invented will-worſhip, and encourage painful, conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entious Miniſters, more then their Predeceſſors have done lazy, idle drones: I durſt become their bondman, if one or both of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſe two things did not follow, that all the godly, ſober, religious people in the Land, would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come their faſt friends, and ſtrive who ſhould do them moſt honour; or elſe the Devil and all his Inſtruments would be as mad againſt them, as they are now again already againſt the Puritans.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <hi>3.</hi> Once again, we ſee what it is that makes the <hi>Church</hi> glorious and unanimous; <hi>viz.</hi> living up to the noble principles of Religion, in ſelf-denial, humility, piety, in all ranks of people: For till the love of the Lord Jeſus, and the deſire of the ſalvation of ſouls, hath taken more root in the hearts of Paſtors and Chriſtians, we cannot expect any Settlement, Beauty or Order in the Church: 'Tis not the priding of a mans ſelf in the name of a Son of the Church, can advantage Religion, no more then the Jews boaſting they had <hi>Abraham</hi> to their Father, did promote it among them: For our Saviour tells them, when that cry was loudeſt, the ſtate of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion was at the loweſt among them: No, the Church,
<pb facs="tcp:44083:21"/> the Spouſe of Chriſt, is meek-hearted, and lowly, full of tenderneſs and goodneſs, and her children indeed are like her: But they, which inſtead of this ſpirit, fall a beating their Brethren, or ſcoffing or envying at them, may indeed be in the Church, but yet as <hi>Cain</hi> in <hi>Adams,</hi> and <hi>Iſhmael</hi> in <hi>Abrahams</hi> family, onely the ſpots and blemiſhes thereof.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <hi>4.</hi> Yet again, I obſerve the ligaments and ſoder of theſe Churches, to be their mutual conſent in Diſcipline, which we ſee required not onely of Miniſters, but of all Chriſtians: how neceſſary this is, experience doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate: For the firſt primitive Church had no other bond, nor have the Reformed Churches abroad in many places any other; not but that the Patronage of Princes and Magiſtrates is a great Strength and Bulwark to Religion; and that people are bound to bleſs God ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly, when he <hi>raiſeth up ſuch Nurſing Fathers for the Church to be over it in the Lord.</hi> Yet we ſee, that meer Politique bands do ſnap aſunder, and make way for ſchiſm and diviſion; eſpecially, when the Pruden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial ſuperior Order of the Clergie do ride, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior grind; for then they are apt to take the firſt oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to unyoke themſelves: But if a ſuperiority among Miniſters in the Church on a prudential account, be thought neceſſary (for <hi>Humanum inſtitutum epiſcopa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus non damnamus ſed tantum negamus a Chriſto eſſe Imperatum,</hi> as we ſay with <hi>Junius</hi>) let it be ſet up by the mutual conſent and choice of the reſt, or the Body of the Miniſtry, and their obedience will be more conſtant in the Lord, and more fixed, then by any ſubſcription of oaths of Canonical obedience whatſoever. In a word, let the poyſon, and what was not from the beginning, be taken out of the Ordinances and offices of Chriſt in the Church,
<pb facs="tcp:44083:22"/> and the power of godlineſs in good earneſt endeavoured, and this Church, which is otherwiſe giving up the ghoſt, will yet through the bleſſing of God recover and do well, and we ſhall have great cauſe to bleſs God for this true Proteſtant Biſhop <hi>Comenius</hi> his pious Endeavours, in laying this Book at his Majeſties feet, as an expedient for an Accommodation, not with the Romiſh, but the Reformed Churches. Which that it may effect is the earneſt prayer of him how is</p>

            <p n="2">2. If we take them in a divided ſenſe, of the Catholick
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:44083:27"/> Church divided into particular Churches; it is plain, that the Churches may, and ought to be ſo diſtinguiſhed and reckoned of, as they are really and truly in the account of God: That is to ſay, as ſome Churches are novel, coming up but of late, the <hi>Light</hi> whereof is as the <hi>Morning;</hi> ſo there be <hi>others</hi> of longer ſtanding, having the advantages of clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er light, <hi>as the Moon.</hi> Others alſo, joying in the full day of Faith, Love, and Hope of Eternal mercy, even as the <hi>Sun.</hi> Others again, over and above this glorious light with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, ſparkling terror outwardly to th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>riking horrour into the Enemies, the very Battel being ſet, and Colours fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
            <p n="3">3. If we take the words in a conjoyned ſenſe, of the one onely entire Catholique Church, of which Chriſt ſpeaks in the former verſe, <hi>My Dove is but one entire;</hi> without doubt we have inſinuated the ſeveral ages and ſtatures of it, <hi>viz.</hi> that the light of the infant Church, newly come forth (in the Apoſtles times) was verily the Morning: the godly moſt<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly glorying herein, that the night was far ſpent, the day was at hand, and it was now time to awake from ſleep, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.11, 12. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.19. at which time (the truth is) Divine Knowledge was not improved as it was afterward: Neither was there ſuch a clear and diſtinct underſtanding of the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries of Faith, as there was after that the dotages of the Hereticks had exerciſed the wiſdom of the Church; yet it ſufficed them even now as to this effect; <hi>viz.</hi> to caſt off the works of darkneſs, and put on the armour of light, and to walk honeſtly as in the day (<hi>Rom.</hi> 13.13.) as their then zealous piety, ſhining in their Martyrdomes, plainly ſheweth.</p>
            <p n="4">4. After this came the time of priming and waining light, as of the Moon, in the days of the Hereticks, with whom the Churches conflict was with various ſucceſs, one while the truth prevailing againſt errour; another while errour a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the truth, until the time that it ſuffered an horrid eclipſe under Antichriſt.</p>
            <pb n="11" facs="tcp:44083:27"/>
            <p n="5">5. But there was (by the Grace of God, and the benefit of a Reformation) a reſtoring of the light which was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed in the Church, with a new addition; and that was according to the promiſe made, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 30.26. <hi>The light of the Moon, ſhall be as the light of the Sun:</hi> There being a more through ſearch made after the truth, even to the very loweſt foundations, then was ever known in former ages.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Yet becauſe the very Sun in our firmament (though no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is more bright) may, and ſometimes doth fail, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 17.31. and by the permiſſion of God even the Reformed Churches ſtill again ſuffer the hour of darkneſs; the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and wiſdom of the everlaſting <hi>Bridegroom</hi> gives us hope that it ſhall come to paſs, that the Church ſhall at laſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come terrible to her enemies; and intimateth in what way this ſhall be effected, to wit, if (through Gods bleſſing) dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences being ended, the Church ſhall ſometime at length, ſo unite it ſelf on every ſide within it ſelf, and knit together by the bands of Order, as that after the manner of a well ſet Array of battel, ſhe ſhall be impenetrable by her ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, but run through, rout and quaſh all contrary forces or powers whatſoever that riſe up againſt her.</p>
            <p n="7">7. And this is none other but that which the Apoſtle urg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth upon the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> and requireth of the Church now grown up, ſaying, <hi>Endeavouring to preſerve the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity of the Spirit in the band of peace, &amp;c.</hi> then further, <hi>Aſcending up on high, he gave gifts to men, ſome Apoſtles, ſome Prophets, ſome Evangeliſts, ſome Paſtors and Teachers, for the compact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Saints, for the work of the Miniſtery, for the edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the body of Chriſt, until we all come in the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity of the Faith, and the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the meaſure of the full ſtature of Chriſt; that we be no more children toſſed to and fro, and carried about with eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry wind of Doctrine, by the ſlight of men, &amp;c.</hi> but carrying it <hi>ſincerely in charity, may grow up into him, which is the head, even Chriſt: From whom the whole body fitly joyned together, and compact by all the joynts contributing from the inward working-power, according to the meaſure of every part, obtaineth en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:44083:28"/> ſuitable to the body, unto the building up of its ſelf in love,</hi> Eph. 4.3, &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="8">8. Whereof ſeeing we are in expectation from Divine goodneſs, why ſhould we not be rationally enquiring out the way of that Union and Order, on which there is laid ſo great adreſs for the ſalvation of the Church? and mutually afford one another participation and improvement both of Light and Order? It is pious and praiſe-worthy not to be found ſlack in this matter.</p>
            <p n="9">9. As for me (into whoſe ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d is now come an opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of bringing forth to light in a new edition, the <hi>Order of the Church of the Brethren of</hi> Bohemia) I apprehend it much to the buſineſs, to ſet before your eyes in the example of this very Church, by what ſteps God is wont to lead on and perfect his people; which whoſoever of the godly read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, will eaſily finde occaſion ſeriouſly to conſider, the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable method of Divine Providence about himſelf, as well as about the Church.</p>
            <p n="10">10. God hath done all things well, and made every thing beautiful in its ſeaſon, ſaith <hi>Solomon,</hi> Eccleſ. 3.11. implying, that the works of God do always proceed in a certain order, and ſtep by ſtep, from leſs to more; even the work of Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the work of Redemption, the work of Sanctification, and the whole courſe of Divine Providence about all things, teach us this very thing, and eſpecially the wonderful wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom hereof, in enlarging the Tents of his Church (which we have now in particular taken under conſideration) ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more, either unto greater bulk or beauty.</p>
            <p n="11">11. The Son of God could indeed (being come into the world in Humane fleſh) have made his Goſpel known by himſelf to the whole world, in the full and compleat myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of Redemption, but he was not pleaſed to do ſo, but ordained ſome certain men Apoſtles; which going through the world, did publiſh among the Nations, thoſe Treaſures of Divine Grace; and they committed the ſame Office to others to ſucceed them, and they again to others, and ſo to the end of the world, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.20. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.7. <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.1.</p>
            <pb n="13" facs="tcp:44083:28"/>
            <p n="12">12. For howbeit the light of the Goſpel was even then by the very Apoſtles ſprinkled throughout the world, even to the ends of the earth (as Scripture and Hiſtories report) yet that light in ſome of thoſe firſt ages, may ſeem to have been rather as ſparks catching upon ſome perſons and fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies here and there, then the full enlightning of the Nations. In the fourth Age indeed in <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the Greats time, whole Nations began to Convert, and renouncing Paganiſm, open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to profeſs the Chriſtian Religion; and then afterward, the Faith having been firſt received in the Empire of <hi>Rome,</hi> and other places, went on conſtantly for twelve Generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons (one Nation after another giving up their names to Chriſt in Baptiſm) throughout <hi>Europe, Aſia, Africa</hi> and <hi>America.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="13">13. The ſuccesful work of Divine Providence was very evident and remarkable in founding the Churches of the Slavonick Counties, ſcituate all along on the Eaſtern parts of <hi>Europe:</hi> Among whom the plantation of the Goſpel be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing planted in the Apoſtles times, proved a fair crop in the fourth Century, &amp; by degrees extended it ſelf in thoſe parts, making the Churches there ſometimes bigger, ſometimes bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; it faring alſo with them now and then, as with the Moon, ſtill to have their light impaired by wainings, ſpots, and miſty overcaſtings. Let me briefly ſumme up the whole evidence hereof, as may ſerve to quicken us even at this time to go forward from good to better, till we take up at length with ſome, attainment worth the acquieſcing in.</p>
            <p n="14">14. That the Goſpel was planted in thoſe Countreys in the Apoſtles times, we have the Apoſtle of the Gentiles for a witneſs, who writes thus to the <hi>Romans, c.</hi> 15. <hi>v.</hi> 19. <hi>I have filled all places with the Goſpel, even from Jeruſalem to Illyricum round about:</hi> And he tells <hi>Timothy,</hi> 2 Tim. 4.10. that <hi>Creſcens</hi> went into <hi>Galatia, Titus</hi> into <hi>Dalmatia:</hi> Now both <hi>Illyricum</hi> and <hi>Dalmatia</hi> are parts of the Slavonick Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey to this day; and that that Plantation did not come to
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:44083:29"/> nothing, it is evident, in that <hi>Jerome</hi> being born at <hi>Strido,</hi> a City in <hi>Illyricum,</hi> to advance the ſucceſs of the faith re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in his own Countrey, tranſlated the Books of the Divine Scriptures into their Mother tongue; by means whereof the Slavonians were the firſt of all the parts of <hi>Europe</hi> that were intruſted with the Oracles of God in their Mother Tongue. At this very day do theſe Countreys glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in that Tranſlation, and will uſe no other, although the language of that people be ſo much altered, that the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſort of them in many things do not underſtand that ancient form of ſpeech. Therefore their Prieſts (the <hi>Rut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenians,</hi> and the <hi>Moſcians</hi>) are fain to ſtudy that ancient Language, as we do the Latine.</p>
            <p n="15">15. That the Churches in theſe Countreys did very much encreaſe, we may eaſily gather from the ſixth Synod of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople,</hi> held in the year of Chriſt 680. making very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable mention of the <hi>Slavonians,</hi> in theſe words, This Council being at the beſt but low and obſcure, expected the help of all, neither ought that which one part doth, be hid from the other; eſpecially, for that it is well known, that in the heart of the Countreys, we have very many Fellow-ſervants, both <hi>Longobards</hi> and <hi>Slavonians,</hi> which are ſtill buſily ſcrupulous and inquiſitive about this matter, &amp;c. Whence it is plain, the <hi>Slavonians</hi> were at this time Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, and alſo ſuch as abhorred Image-worſhip, in as much as they durſt not joyn with that Synod which ſtickled for Images.</p>
            <p n="16">16. Moreover, in the Age next following, God opened the Door of the Goſpel to whole Countreys of the <hi>Slavo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians;</hi> and the occaſion was this, The <hi>Bulgarians</hi> (a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey of <hi>Slavonia</hi>) infeſted the neighbouring Empire of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople</hi> with continual wars, till <hi>Michael</hi> the third being Emperour, made a peace with them in the year 845. re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoring to the King of the <hi>Bulgarians</hi> his Siſter, which the <hi>G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ecians</hi> had taken in battel. Now this Lady being in her Captivity ſeaſoned with the Chriſtian Religion, prevailed with her Brother to renounce Heatheniſm, and turn Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian.
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:44083:29"/> Hereupon his ſubjects following his example, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced the ſame faith: By this means, the <hi>Bulgarians</hi> became the firſt fruits of the Slavonian Nations unto Chriſt. Other people in thoſe Coaſts or Regions about <hi>Danubium, Greece</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi> of the ſame Language, preſently treading in their ſteps; <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Moeſians, Raſcians, Servians, Boſnians, Croatians, &amp;c.</hi> which contributed much aſſiſtance to <hi>Cyril</hi> and <hi>Methudius,</hi> they being Grecian Biſhops, but ready and expert in the Slavonick Tongue. Theſe paſſing on, and about the year 861, entring into <hi>Moravia,</hi> (then by the Germans called <hi>Marcomannia</hi>) there alſo they convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto Chriſt <hi>Suatoplucus</hi> their King; and a little after that <hi>Borivoius</hi> a Duke of the Bohemians. From thence the bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the <hi>Goſpel</hi> darted into <hi>Polonia,</hi> in the year of Chriſts 65. the 71 year after the converſion of the <hi>Bohemians,</hi> of the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ravians</hi> the 104. of the <hi>Bulgarians</hi> the 120. Fifteen years af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this, in the year 980. the <hi>Ruſſi,</hi> and the <hi>Moſci,</hi> and the <hi>Slavonian</hi> Counties, turned wholly to the Chriſtian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; <hi>Anna, Baſil,</hi> the Emperours ſiſter, being given in marriage to <hi>Wlodimire</hi> a <hi>Kyovienſian</hi> Duke.</p>
            <p n="17">17. From hence it appears, that all theſe Countreys con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted by the means of the Eaſtern Church, even the <hi>Bohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mian</hi> too were Chriſtianized with the Grecian Rites and Forms. But the Pope of <hi>Rome,</hi> which even at this time lay in wait to make a prey of all the Churches in the World, let ſlip no opportunity whereby he might bring them under the yoke of his juriſdiction. What opportunities were given, I muſt in brief relate, were it onely for the ſake of <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="18">18.

By whom many of the Noblemen, and even all their Sacerdotes or Miniſters, were either ſlain or taken captive, and ſo impriſoned or baniſhed, and driven into the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Provinces of <hi>Germany,</hi> until the year 940. when <hi>Otto</hi> the Emperour coming upon them with an Army, cool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their courage, reſtraining their fury, making <hi>Boleſlaus</hi> reſtore the Temples, and call home the baniſhed, and take order that Children be initiated with Chriſtian Rites, <hi>i. e.</hi> bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized.

            <p n="19">19. Good <hi>Boleſtaus</hi> (ſon of the Tyrant of that name) being deſirous very much to propagate the Chriſtian <hi>Religion,</hi> founded a Biſhoprick at <hi>Prague,</hi> and endeavouring <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

For howbeit the new Pope, named <hi>Martin</hi> the fifth, choſen by the Council of <hi>Conſtance,</hi> inticed the <hi>Bohemians</hi> by charming Letters ſent to them, 1418. to renounce the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours of the <hi>Wicklegians</hi> and <hi>Huſſites;</hi> yet afterward, 1420. Excommunication being denounced againſt them at <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,</hi> he invited and animated to Arms againſt them, <hi>Caeſar,</hi> the Kings, Princes, Dukes, Marqueſſes, Earls, Barons, Governours, Cities and Commonwealths; and adjures them by the Wounds of Chriſt, and the happineſs of every one of them, that with joyned forces they would ſet upon them, and utterly root out ſuch a Sacrilegious, curſed people.</p>
            <p n="33">33. <hi>Sigiſmond</hi> the King being inflamed with this Incen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, together with all <hi>Germany,</hi> and the adjacent Kingdoms, proſtitutes himſelf to be as Agitator <hi>on the behalf of the Antichriſtian</hi> Tyranny; and a little after that ſame year, enters <hi>Bohemia</hi> with a puiſſant Army, and infected it with war for ten years. This is called the <hi>Huſſian,</hi> or <hi>Huſſites</hi> war: Of which <hi>Aeneas Sylvius</hi> (afterward proving Pope <hi>Pius</hi> the eleventh) writes, that it would gain more admiration then credit with Poſterity; for deſigns were managed on their part without any ſucceſs, <hi>Ziſca</hi> the Captain of the <hi>Bohemians</hi> always getting the better.</p>
            <p n="34">34. Beſides, at home alſo the affairs of the <hi>Bohemians</hi>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:44083:37"/> were in great confuſion: For ſome abetted <hi>Caeſar</hi> and the Pope; others maintained the Sacrament cauſe of the Cup: So that both were incenſed unto onſlaughts on each other, with horrible outrage; the Papiſt eſpecially raging againſt the greateſt <hi>Zealots</hi> againſt the Superſtitious, as it is recorded in the Hiſtory of the Perſecutions of the <hi>Bohemian</hi> Church, Chap. 10. where many inſtances of Martyrdom are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited.</p>
            <p n="35">35. So that the <hi>Bohemians</hi> falling into Schiſms among themſelves, the greater part of them, which was the worſt, helped on the Perſecution of the true faithful Chriſtians. They had been indeed all zealous in oppoſing Antichriſt, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the example of Mr. <hi>Huſs:</hi> but now, by reaſon of his death, they being deſtitute of ſome eminent, prudent, va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant Perſon to b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> their Captain, which might keep the hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring rout in ſome good order, they fell a pieces one againſt another, and ſtirred up cruel diſſention among themſelves; for the meaner ſort, both of the Laity and Clergy, onely letting out their ſtrength for the Cup-communion (whence they were called <hi>Calixtini</hi>) were ſecurely negligent of the other points of Mr. <hi>Luther:</hi> But the <hi>Taborites</hi> (among whom <hi>Wencenſlaus Coranda,</hi> and <hi>Nicholaus Epiſcopius</hi> far excelled the reſt) with a few others, attempted to keep up ſimplicity and purity in all the Articles and Ceremonies. The one part cryed, we muſt not ſeparate from the Church in all Rites; the other, we will not endure any Superſtitious Altars.</p>
            <p n="36">36. Some perſons alſo ſtept in under an hypocritical diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſe, which to promote the Kings and the Popes cauſe, widened the breaches, and traducing the Abettors of more pure Doctrine, with the odious name of <hi>Piccardi,</hi> ſtirred up the common peoples abhorrence of them. Now the <hi>Waldenſes</hi> were called <hi>Piccardi,</hi> who in former time being baniſhed out of <hi>France,</hi> ſeated themſelves in <hi>Auſtria,</hi> and had been there branded with the name of the fouleſt Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks: Nay, ſome alſo there were that ſo powerfully wrought upon <hi>Ziſca</hi> the Captain of the <hi>Taborites,</hi> that he came over,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:44083:37"/> and adhered to the <hi>Calixtini,</hi> and Perſecuted the ſaid <hi>Pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cardi</hi> with fire and ſword, even as much as the very <hi>Pontifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians</hi> did. Thus tumultuouſly were all things in all places carried.</p>
            <p n="27">27. So that truly, it had been no wonder, if the Pontifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Faction had utterly rooted out this people, they being at ſuch variance among themſelves: But wonderful was the goodneſs of God, which ſo wiſely over-ruled Humane folly, that neither foes nor friends got any thing of which they could boaſt themſelves: For as often as the King came near the ſelf-divided <hi>Bohemians</hi> with his Army, ſo often did they, renewing peace among themſelves, make good the common cauſe with common ſtrength; <hi>Ziſca</hi> and <hi>Procopius</hi> both as one Captain of the <hi>Taborites,</hi> having the chief con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of affairs, and God granting them wonderful ſucceſſes and victories.</p>
            <p n="38">38. Now therefore the King and Pope ſeeing they could make no work of it by force of Arms, betook themſelves to fraud; and calling yet another Council to <hi>Baſil</hi> (in the year 1432.) there very fairly cog the <hi>Bohemians</hi> into a friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Treaty about theſe differences; and for their publique ſecurity, they would give them any ſatisfaction whatever they would deſire. The Legates then being ſent to the Council, among whom of Divines, the chief were <hi>John Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kyzanus</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Prague,</hi> and <hi>Nicholaus Epiſcopius</hi> Biſhop of the <hi>Taborites;</hi> of the Stateſmen, <hi>Procopius Holy,</hi> Duke of the <hi>Taborites, Wilhelmus Koſtka</hi> Baron of <hi>Poſtupira,</hi> &amp;c. They were courteouſly entertained; and their Queſtions or Poſitions being demanded, they offered four Articles, which they deſired might be granted them, or they were ready to make them good. The Articles were thus formed:</p>
            <pb n="23" facs="tcp:44083:36"/>
            <list>
               <item>1. <hi>That the uſe of the Cup ought to be reſtored to the people, and all the holy things to be celebrated in their Mother Tongue.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>2. <hi>That the Clergy muſt have no ſecular Government.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>3. <hi>That the Word of God muſt be freely taught.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>4. <hi>That publique offences muſt be publiquely reproved.</hi>
               </item>
            </list>
            <p>The Popes Legate demanding, Whether they had any more? for he was told, that they held, that the Orders of the Monks was from the Devil. <hi>Procopius</hi> anſwered, Why, whence can it be, which is inſtituted neither by Patriarchs, nor Prophets, nor by Chriſt, nor his Apoſtles, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="39">39. Then appointed they ſome on both ſides, to hold the Diſputation concerning the Queſtions given, and the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpute laſted full fifty days. Now when they could not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute the <hi>Bohemians,</hi> they came to a friendly Compoſition; and all things were ſo carried (<hi>Rokyzan</hi> being charmed and he inchanting others with the hope of an Archbiſhoprick) that the ſaid Articles were yielded to the <hi>Bohemians,</hi> one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that they ſhould promiſe to return to their obedience to the Roman See, and to obſerve the Ceremonies thereof. This Tranſaction they called <hi>Compactata,</hi> i. e. Articles of Agreement, or Covenants; and ſo the Legates were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched from the Council, and the King into <hi>Bohemia,</hi> to acquaint them, That the <hi>Bohemians</hi> were received into the boſom of the Church, and eſteemed as dear Sons thereof. They call a Convention of Eſtates, wherein <hi>Rokyzan</hi> ſets before them in much ſtate of words, how that according to their own hearts deſire, they had now obtained thoſe things for which they had ſo much waſted the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms treaſure; telling them, that now they had better thoughts of the King and Pope, then ſometime afore, when they called them the Apocalyptical Whore and Beaſt.</p>
            <p n="40">40. It grieved moſt of them, eſpecially the <hi>Zelots</hi> of <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor,</hi> that they ſhould thus ſwerve from <hi>Huſſes</hi> ſteps, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn into the Tents of Antichriſt again: So that they op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:44083:36"/> the agreement what they could, and it came to blows again: But herein the <hi>Taborites</hi> were worſted, and fain to yield, being ſo groſly beaten out, that they could not rally to make any further head or attempt. So that they had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing left to defend themſelves withal, ſave onely the Sword of the Word, and the Shield of Patience. This was done in the year, 1434.</p>
            <p n="41">41. In year 1435. <hi>Rokyzan</hi> was ſolemnly in the Conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Eſtates choſen Archbiſhop; but he taking it impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently that his Conſecration with the ſolemn Rites, was put off by the King, and he deluded, began again, together with his Faction, to buſle againſt the injuſtice of the King and State, and domineering power of the Pope: But fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the King, he withdrew himſelf from <hi>

            <p n="43">43.

            <p n="44">44. But when as for ſome years ſpace, the <hi>Bohemians</hi> had in vain ſollicited the Inveſtiture of their Archbiſhop, and the Pope ſtill refuſed to hearken to them in this matter, unleſs <hi>Rokyzan</hi> would part with the Cup: (yea, moreover, 1448.) ſending the Cardinal of St. <hi>Angelo</hi> to <hi>Prague,</hi> under pretence of a Treaty, gave order to ſurprize and force out of their cuſtody the <hi>Compactata,</hi> or the Covenant-Rolls, wherewithal he was fled; but being called back, was compelled to reſtore them, and let them go:) <hi>Rokyzan</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming his ſtomack againſt the Pope, juſtified it, that he was that great Antichriſt ſpoken of in the <hi>Apocalyps</hi> and <hi>Daniel.</hi> And we (ſaith he) unleſs we fall off from obedience to him, are an undone and a damned people: telling them, that they muſt have for the way of Religion; not the <hi>Compactata,</hi> or the <hi>Scroul</hi> of Agreement, but the Law of Chriſt: that all things of the Popes way were to be laid aſide, as being impure; and all things to be wholly reared up out of the foundations of the Apoſtles: In a word, he ſo payed Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:44083:35"/> that moſt of them believed him to be a ſecond <hi>Huſs,</hi> and were in expectation of no leſs then a full Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p n="45">45. But becauſe he did not put his hand to the work all this while, they of his Auditory, which were more real, (of which the very chief was <hi>Gregory, Rokyzans</hi> Nephew by his ſiſter, a man of a Noble extraction) ſaying their heads together, come to <hi>Rokyzan,</hi> lay open their troubles of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and ask his advice. He entreated them lovingly, and commending their zeal, produced them ſome Tractates to read concerning the Abomination which was crept into the Church, and ſo kindled their zeal yet more; but withal, adv ſed them to ſilence and patience. When yet again the third time, their number being now encreaſed, they were inſtant with him, that what he had declared for in words he would not delay in very deed to perform, He anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, it was a buſineſs of great concernment and difficulty, wherein nothing could be done ſuddenly, &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="46">46. In the mean time, <hi>Rokyzan</hi> beſti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>s himſelf all he could againſt the Pope, endeavouring alſo the joynt conſent of the Gre k Church: For becauſe the decree of the <hi>Florentine</hi> Synod (by which the <hi>Bohemians</hi> were again as Hereticks cut off from the Church) was come forth, there was holden at <hi>Prague</hi> (in the year, 1450.) a Convention of Eſtates, and a Synod of Prieſts. Now here it was, that by <hi>Rokyzans</hi> advice, and the common conſent of the Eſtates and the Clergy, an appeal was made to the Greek Church, and Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates were diſpatched away with Letters to <hi>Conſtantinople.</hi> The Greeks when they had heard the Contents of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

But theſe things lying yet in hope, coming on ſlowly, giving ſome ground of hope, <hi>Rokyzan</hi> doth again animate his Clients, and openly gives them to underſtand, that it was hopeful that a Reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on would even now ſhortly appear. For, ſaid he, taxing
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:44083:38"/> the many abuſes, we do but touch ſome things which lie uppermoſt in the ſurface; but they will appear ſhortly who will rip up the Foundations of Truth from the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom.</p>
            <p n="47">47. Thus when he had whiled of theſe godly ſouls unto the ſeventh year; being again adviſed with, he ſaid, He had now caſt about all things in his minde, and did not ſee what to reſolve upon, unleſs to make a ſeparation wholly, as well from the <hi>Calixtines</hi> as the Papiſts; for now all was full of Abomination, and the miſchief was paſt cure. To the like effect was alſo the advice of <hi>Lupacius.</hi> They ſaid, then let us fall off, we will own, honour, follow thee for our Leader, Doctor and Father. But he anſwered, You lay upon me, ſaid he, a hard task: you are too bold, the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is full of danger, and the like.</p>
            <p n="48">48. <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> was now again in the year, 1453. ſacked, and ſpoiled by the Turks: at which time two of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperſed <hi>Grecians</hi> eſcaping, come to <hi>Prague,</hi> and there were made welcome by <hi>Rokyzan,</hi> he after much conference with them about Religion, admitted them alſo to the Celebrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Lords Supper. At which, when they ſaw that here even amongſt theſe, the ſimplicity of faith was ſo much defaced in Superſtitions, thoſe good zealots were yet more troubled in their mindes, ſeeing what to fly, but not having what to follow.</p>
            <p n="49">49. Therefore they come again to <hi>Rok<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

But he good man, having not ſo much courage, as to deſpiſe the (hitherto plainly vain) hope of Arch-epiſcopal glory, and to chuſe ſhame and the Croſs, with the people of God; was now wrath, and upbraided them with their importunity, and bids them they ſhould let the buſineſs fall, and withdraw from him; that he would beg for them of the King (<hi>George Podebrand,</hi> which to gain the Crown, had ſworn obedience to the Pope) ſome place where they might live ſafely, and ſerve God with a pure conſcience.</p>
            <pb n="33" facs="tcp:44083:38"/>
            <p n="50">50. And he obtained the Principality of <hi>Litica</hi> in the mountanous places of the neighborhood of <hi>Sileſia,</hi> whether preſently the Citizens of <hi>Prague,</hi> both Batchelors and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters betake themſelves; others both Commons and Nobles learned and unlearned elſewhere thereabout, in great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, giving themſelves diligently to the reading of the Scriptures, prayer and works of piety. Their Paſtors were of the Calixtines which renounced the ſuperſtitions, and addreſſed themſelves after the form of the Apoſtolical ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity; among which <hi>Micael Bradacius</hi> Paſtor of <hi>Zamberg,</hi> a pious and devout old man, was the chiefeſt. Theſe all called one another mutually, by the common and (to the godly) dear name of Brethren and Siſters; by which means it was, that the title of the <hi>Brethren of Bohemia</hi> is given to them by way of eminency even to this day.</p>
            <p n="51">51. They began indeed to call themſelves <hi>The Brethren of the Law of Chriſt,</hi> as well to diſtinguiſh themſelves from the orders of the <hi>Papiſts</hi> (as alſo from the <hi>Benedictines, Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſcans, &amp;c.</hi>) as to inſiſt upon the foundation of Mr. <hi>Huſs, viz.</hi> That the Law of Chriſt is ſufficient for the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Church Militant, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But afterward when they obſerved it was drawn into a calumny (the adverſaries cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that they founded a new Order of Monks) they left it off, ſaluting one another not amiſs with the title of <hi>THE BROTHERLY <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>NITED CH<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>RCHES,</hi> or the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>NITY OF THE BRETHREN.</hi> For as the Church is the company of them which are called out of the world to partake of ſalvation, by Faith in Chriſt, knit together by the Laws of mutual charity; even ſo <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity Eccleſiaſtical is with us the company of Churches knit together in the Laws of mutual love, for the mutual edification of one another, in the common ſalvation;</hi> fully according to the mind of the holy Ghoſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 133. and <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. and elſewhere ſet down in the Scriptures.</p>
            <p n="52">52. But Satan was wroth, with thoſe beginnings of the Church, undertaking a Reformation according to the Laws
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:44083:39"/> of the Goſpel; he therefore raiſed a new and horrible tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt to overwhelm it; for the fame of this flying all abroad, the Prieſts every where ſtirred up the people to hate them; <hi>Choak</hi> (they cried) <hi>choak the ſpark leaſt it grow into a flame. Rokyſan</hi> himſelf (who one would think ſtrange) puts on the diſpoſition of an enemy, and accuſes them of headſtrong impiety; for there was no want of ſuch as would traduce them to the King and Conſiſtory, with variety of imputations.</p>
            <p n="53">53. Hereupon it came to paſs (in the year 1461.) that our Brother <hi>Gregory,</hi> with ſome others, viſiting the Brethren at <hi>Prague,</hi> they being aſſembled together in a certain houſe were betrayed and taken: Where take notice of this remark of providence; The Governor entring, ſtayed at the door of the room where they were met, and beſpake them in theſe words of Scripture, <hi>All you that will live godly in Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus ſhall ſuffer perſecution: You therefore that are here follow me to priſon,</hi> for he was a good man, and meant well to the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs of the Brethren, but could not do otherwiſe becauſe of the command of his betters.</p>
            <p n="54">54. The King by reaſon of the complaints the wicked made of them to him, was perſwaded that the Brethren of the Taborites (as they called them) had ſome plot in hand, therefore he commanded that that holy man <hi>Gregory</hi> ſhould be put upon the rack; but he falling into a deep Trance or extaſie, felt no pain, and ſo they left him upon the rack by the tormentors for dead. <hi>Rokyzan</hi> his Unkle, coming in to him, and finding him dead on the wrack, lamented over him with many tears, redoubling it, <hi>I would I were in thy place, O my Gregory,</hi> but he afterward, coming to himſelf, related the viſion, which in this wheel he had ſeen; That he was carried into a moſt pleaſant meadow, in the midſt of which ſtood a tree loaden with fruit, and many kinds of birds ſitting on the leaves, feeding on it; there ſtanding in the middle a youth governing the birds with a cane, ſo that none of them durſt get away out of order. In which ſight without doubt, God intended to give the picture of that Church whereof he was as the <hi>Patriarch.</hi> He ſaw alſo other

            <p n="57">57. Upon this a ſore Inquiſition was reſolved, and execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted upon the Brethren, and ſo hot it was, that moſt of them, eſpecially the chief being diſperſed into the Mountains and woods, dwelt in caves or dens; neither yet there being ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently ſafe, therefore they dared not to make any fire for kitchin uſe, ſave only in the night, leaſt the ſmoak going forth ſhould betray them; and then ſitting about the fire in the ſharp cold air, they would ſpend their time in reading the Scriptures and holy conferences; and as oft as they came forth in the deep ſnow to provide them neceſſaries, leaſt they ſhould be traced, they trod all in the ſame foot-prints, the laſt man drawing after him a Turpentine bough to cover all, that it might ſeem to be only the track of ſome Countryman drawing about ſome buſh-wood. From this their dwelling in ſuch lurking places they were afterward in a ſcoff called <hi>Jamnici</hi> or Cavers.</p>
            <p n="58">58. Moreover theſe Brethren made a certain order among themſelves, that the Seniors ſhould be choſen by votes, and have the ordering of affairs allotted to them, and the reſt promiſe to be ordered by them; then with the advice and counſel of theſe, the chief (of them which were of the diſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion through <hi>Bohemia</hi> and <hi>Moravia</hi>) being called, they held Synods in thoſe mountains, and made certain decrees, <hi>viz.</hi> How they ſhould carry it among themſelves, how towards others, friends and foes, alſo Kings and Magiſtrates, and the like, often ſetting apart times of praying and faſting among themſelves with the diſperſed, and conſulting out of the word of God about thoſe things which were needful for a reformation of life and Doctrine.</p>
            <p n="59">59. Their cheif care was for Paſtors of ſouls, where they ſhould procure them, when they which they now had were deceaſed; that to expect till ſome of the Roman Ordination ſhould out of love to the truth come over to them, was a matter of uncertain hope: And they remembred that <hi>Roky<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zan</hi> did often affirm profeſſedly, that all things muſt be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed to the very foundations; that therefore Ordination was to be ſet on foot at home, by that power which Chriſt
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:44083:40"/> hath given to his Church, That while they had ſome ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed among them, they ſhould ordain others, and they again others ſtill to ſucceed them, and their deſires inclined much this way, as alſo their judgements. But there was one thing which did ſtrike their hearts with ſome fear, whether that Ordination would be legitimate enough, if a Presbyter or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain a Presbyter without a Biſhop, and how they ſhould be able to defend ſuch ordination if it ſhould be called in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, either amongſt others or their own.</p>
            <p n="60">60. At length after many perplexing thoughts for ſome years together, it was agreed (in the year 1467.) that the emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nenteſt men out of <hi>Bohemia</hi> and <hi>Moravia</hi> of about fifty years old, ſhould with many tears and prayers poured out to God (reſolve to make evidence of the will of God by lot) that he would be ſo pleaſed to declare whether that which was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded were acceptable to him, and ſeaſonable at that time. Then they by votes choſe from among them nine men, which they judged fit before the reſt to take the office of the Miniſtry upon them; and they put into the hand of a child (called into the Aſſembly, not knowing what was do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing) twelve hidden lots or ſchedules, and bid him diſtribute to theſe nine; nine of them were blancks; <hi>EST, It is he,</hi> being written upon three only; whereupon it might have ſo faln out, that all the nine might have had blancks, and this was to be the diſcovery of the negative will of God; but ſo it came to paſs, that thoſe three that were written on, did alight into the hands of three among them, <hi>viz. Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thias Kunwaldius,</hi> a moſt pious perſon, <hi>Thomas Prelaucius,</hi> a very learned perſon; <hi>Elias Krenovius,</hi> eminent for ſingular diligence and induſtry.</p>
            <p n="61">61. They imbracing theſe with joy as given to them by a Divine hand, began to conſult about their confirmation, even by a new way of Ordination; and they knowing that there was ſome <hi>Waldenſes</hi> in the Borders of <hi>Moravia</hi> and <hi>Auſtria</hi> (that they might conſult for ſatisfaction of the ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of the conſciences of others, as well as their own, both for the preſent and future) they ſend unto them <hi>Michal
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:44083:41"/> Zamberg</hi> with two others to acquaint them with what they had done, and ask their judgement concerning it: They light upon <hi>Stephen</hi> their Biſhop then, getting another Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop, and ſome of the Miniſters to be preſent with him, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare unto them their original, the Articles of their Doctrine, and what horrid things they had undergon in <hi>Italy</hi> and <hi>France:</hi> They alſo hearing, approving and joying them up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the relation they made of their ſeparation from the Pope and the Calixtines: Yea moreover creating them three Biſhops by impoſition of their hands they conferred on them power to ordain Miniſters, and ſent them away.</p>
            <p n="62">62. Our Brethren were glad to underſtand theſe thlngs, and being deſirous of Chriſtian Unity, they deliberate whether they might not fall in to make one people and one Church with the <hi>Waldenſes;</hi> They were very much taken with the purity of their Doctrine, and their endeavour of a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an converſation; but it diſpleaſed them, that they conceal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the truth and did not profeſs it freely, but ſtudying to evade perſecutions, frequented the Churches of the Papiſts, and communicated in their Idolatrous worſhip. It was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved that they would admoniſh them of this and ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things; therefore ſending again fit perſo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>, they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint the <hi>Waldenſes</hi> with theſe things. They teſtified their good liking of their purpoſe to come into unity with them, giving them to underſtand that as to the faults they charged upon them, they were neither ignorant of them, nor did they excuſe them, but confeſſed they were departed from the ancient purity of their Fathers, and would bethink them of amending. They agreed on both parts, that upon a certain time they would give one another a meeting to take further order about the buſineſs; but before that time came, the Papiſts, this being divulged, began to rage a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the good <hi>Waldenſes. Stephen</hi> their Superintendent at <hi>Vienna</hi> ſuffers burning, the reſt (the moſt of them getting over to <hi>Marchia,</hi> and from thence) were ſcatterd to <hi>Moravia</hi> and eſpecially <hi>Fulneca.</hi>

And from this tranſaction of the Brethren of <hi>Bohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mia</hi> with the <hi>Waldenſes,</hi> it aroſe that afterward they were alſo honoured with the name of <hi>Waldenſes:</hi> But they would never own it, complaining often publickly in their writings That it was given to them through a miſtake. And herein they alledge for the cauſe both Truth and neceſſity; Truth becauſe they took not their Doctrine from them, nor were they the Authors that founded that Unity; nor yet were they reformed by them, but they themſelves deſired to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed of their miſchievous errors by them. Again it was of Neceſſity, becauſe they thought it prudence not to derive up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on themſelves, but rather to decline the Decrees made &amp; pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed by the Magiſtrates againſt the <hi>Waldenſes;</hi> yet withal, that they received from the <hi>Waldenſes</hi> power of Ordination, and thereby external Succeſſion, they would never deny, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though for the preſent time it was their wiſdom to paſs over even this in ſilence.</p>
            <p n="64">64. But it pleaſed God that the Brethren in <hi>Bohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mia</hi> ſhould be Fellow-ſufferers with the <hi>Waldenſes</hi> in the <hi>Auſtrian</hi> Perſecution: For <hi>George</hi> the King, ſolemnly calling the Eſtates into a Convention (in the year 1468.) enacted a bloody Statute againſt them, <hi>That e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one of the Nobles in their reſpective Territories of his Principality or Juriſdiction, ſhould do his endeavour to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend whom ſoever they could of the</hi> Piccardi, <hi>and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely puniſh them upon occaſion according to their pleaſure,</hi> By this ſeverity to compel the ſeparation. Hereupon there were ſore Perſecutions until the deceaſe of <hi>George,</hi> on <hi>March</hi> 22. in the year 1471. (<hi>Rokyzan</hi> being dead Fifteen days before) And now then the Halcion days ſeemed to return, God wonderfully preſerving that little Flock; By which means was fulfilled that Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie of <hi>Matthias Gannovius,</hi> deceaſed a whole year before, <hi>Of a mean people to ariſe without ſword and outward power, which yet the enemies of the Truth ſhould not be able to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail over.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="65">65. For there ſucceeded to <hi>George, Wladiſlaus</hi> the Pole, a
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:44083:42"/> moſt meek Prince, under whom things were like to be in a more quiet State, but that the Adverſaries ſtirred him up, and put him on, and yet this a good while in vain, for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though preſently in the ſecond year of his reign (1472) he ſuffered a decree to paſs for the rooting them out, yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving from the Brethren their Apology, and ſupplication, that he would tolerate them in their native Country, as faithful and quiet Subjects, ſeeking nothing but to pleaſe God, and their King, and all men in that which is good, he preſently checked it, as alſo many times afterward, until the year 1508. Wherein they extorted from him, (very much reniting) that kind of bloody inſtrument, yet ſtill without any effect as they intended. Amongſt other <hi>Boute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feus,</hi> was <hi>Bohuſlaus</hi> of <hi>Lohkowitz,</hi> Baron of <hi>Haſſenſtein</hi> a moſt renouned Orator and Poet in his time, Secretary to the King; in the fourth Book of whoſe Epiſtle written to the King, 1497. theſe words are to be read, <hi>This moſt of all vexes me, that, that ſeditious faction, who under King</hi> George <hi>and</hi> Rokyzan <hi>(though accuſed of Hereſie) durſt not ſo much as peep, ſhould now under a Catholick King ſo take root, and ſo far ſpread its branches, that it can ſcarcely be rooted out, or pulled up by the ſtrength of man.</hi>

            <p n="66">66.

Then the Brethren convene in a Synod, and caſt about again what is needful yet to be done: And that they might in the mean while, at leaſt before God, clear their Conſciences of the guilt of Schiſm, and alſo put Poſterity into ſome certain way, they made a Canon, <hi>That if God ſhall yet any where raiſe up pious Teachers and Reformers of that Church, they will joyn themſelves to them, &amp;c.</hi> This was done, 1486.</p>
            <p n="68">68.

<pb n="42" facs="tcp:44083:43"/> Divinity: To whom the Brethren by two of their own (<hi>Nicholaus Claudius,</hi> and <hi>Laurence Wotik</hi>) ſend their Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy, dedicating it to King <hi>Wladiſtaus;</hi> and printing it at <hi>Noriberg,</hi> in the year 1408 their requeſt was, that he would read over the Book, and ingenuouſly tell them of the faults therein, and they were ready to correct them: But if he found nothing amiſs therein, that he would daign to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend it by his teſtimony, to vindicate the innocent from wrong as much as in him lay. Some days after he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, That he did obſerve nothing amiſs therein; but as for atteſting ſuch things under his hand, it ſeemed neither ſafe for him, nor neceſſary for the Brethren; as well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they which were prejudiced againſt them under the name of <hi>Piccardi,</hi> would not be any thing the better ſatisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed concerning them by his teſtimonial; as alſo, that by ſo commending them which all men had an evil eye upon, he ſhould onely effect thus much, that by the prevalency of the Popiſh party, his writings would be ſuppreſſed, and not come to hand, even ſuch writings of his, as out of which he commonly heard the ſeeds of true piety were gathered; and whereby rebudding Religion, which was yet as it were in the bud or ſhooting, might by little and little be much ſet forward, all men having now liberty to read them. See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing therefore his judgement and approbation given, would render them neither better, not better eſteemed, he thought it beſt to keep himſelf ſafe for ſome better ſervice to the Church. So the Brethren went on according to the Orders they had made among themſelves, to propagate the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom unto more and more purity.</p>
            <p n="71">71. Yet nevertheleſs, he gave teſtimony to the Brethren two ways; <hi>viz.</hi> Firſt, by the by, as it were, in his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face to the New-Teſtament; and then profeſſedly, in an<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſwering <hi>John Schletch,</hi> which calumniated the Brethren.

Muſt take, not for miſerable but for bleſſed, them which are ſpoiled of their goods, driven from their Demeſus, and live in ſorrows. Muſt reckon death deſirable to the godly, as that which is nothing elſe but a paſſage to immortality.

Wherefore let them which are as Angels underſtand, that any man may excel perhaps in curious diſcourſe, and yet be no Chriſtian: But to live like an Angel, free from all impurity; this to gain by perſwaſion, this is the great work of a Divine. Doth any one interrupt me by cavilling at theſe things as dotages, as inſipid ſtuff, ſhallow, fooliſh buſineſſes; in anſwer onely thus, The ſhallow mplicities are thoſe things which Chriſt moſt what teaches, which the Apoſtles inculcate or inſiſt upon Theſe bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſes, how Idiot lik<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

This bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous, illiterate Philoſophy, as it ſeems to them, hath been of that force upon the greateſt Princes in the world yea, many Kingdoms, many Nations, that it hath born ſuch aſway, and brought them into conformity thereunto: that which all the force of Tyrants, all the learning of the Philoſophers could never do. Neither yet do I deny, but they may (if they pleaſe) ſpeak wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom too among them which are perfect: But upon this very ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, let the meaner, low rank of Chriſtians comfort them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, that the Apoſtles, whether they skilled thoſe ſubtilties or no, let who can, take care to prove, I am ſure they taught them not.</hi>

            <q>That thoſe Brethren chuſe their Prieſts themſelves, it is not contrary to the cuſtom of the Ancients: For ſo was S. <hi>Nichalaus</hi> choſen, ſo S. <hi>Ambroſe.</hi> That thoſe they chooſe are not ſo learned, is very tolerable, where the piety of the Converſation makes amends for the want of more learning. That they ſalute one another by the names of Brethren and Siſters, I do not ſee wherein it is blame-wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy: And I would, that among all Chriſtians, that ſame compellation of mutual love were ſtill in uſe, That they give leſs to Doctors, then to the Divine Books; <hi>i. e.</hi> aſcribe more unto God then to men, is according to ſound judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.

            <p n="73">73. About a hundred years elapſing after the deceaſe of <hi>Huſs,</hi> that the propheſie of that holy Martyr might be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled <hi>(An hundred years hence you ſhall anſwer for this before God and me:)</hi> God raiſed up <hi>Germans</hi> Reformer, magnani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous <hi>Luther;</hi> who taking offence at the Papiſts impudency in ſelling Pardons, began openly, and with great zeal to withſtand their errours, <hi>anno</hi> 1517. and indeed with great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ſucceſs then any which were before him.

But as for us, though we may ſeem more learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, yet becauſe we neglect the care of Diſcipline, we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit very little; wherefore we are thinking by all means how to ſettle it.

Great indeed is the goodneſs of God toward you, in that you retain the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine ſo pure, and have ſuch diſciples as diligently take care to bring back the Diſcipline into the Church, as it were out of baniſhment. Truly we are much aſhamed of our ſelves, when we compare at any time our Church with this of yours.

At the ſame time there wrote to the Brethren of <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemia</hi> alſo two other Divines, <hi>Fabricins Capito,</hi> and <hi>John Calvin,</hi> Paſtor of the baniſhed French Church then at <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gentorat.</hi> Part of <hi>Fabricius</hi> Letter runs thus, The Expreſs of your Faith which came to our hands, was very accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to us; it containing your Church Order, abſolutely the beſt that I finde in our generation; in that, together with a ſolid Confeſſion of Faith, and right uſe of the Sacraments, it beareth the ſweet ſavours of holy Diſcipline, and the watchful Paſtoral care among you of your Paſtors. For <hi>Calvins</hi> Letter, it is extant in the Volumn of his Epiſtles, (under this title, <hi>To the Bohemian Paſtors</hi>) of which theſe words are a fragment, I heartily congratulate your Churches, upon which, beſides ſound Doctrine, God hath beſtowed ſo many excellent gifts, whereof this is none of the leaſt,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:44083:46"/> to have ſuch Paſtors to govern and order them, and ſuch people as are ſo well affected and diſpoſed towards Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: To be conſtituted in ſo excellent a ſorm, adorned with the moſt excellent Diſcipline, which we worthily call the moſt excellent, yea, and the onely bond whereby obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience can be preſerved. I am ſure, we finde with us by wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful experience, what the worth of it is, by the want of it; nor yet can we any way attain unto it. God bleſs me! this very thing makes me often faint in my minde, and feeble in the diſcharge of my Function; yea, I ſhould quite deſpair, did not this comfort me, that the edification of the Church is always none other then the work of the Lord, which he himſelf will carry on by his own power, though all help beſides fails. But yet this is a great and rare bleſſing, to be aſſiſted with other neceſſary advantages; therefore I ſhall never take our Churches to be in any poſture of ſtrength, or firm eſtabliſhment, until we can be knit toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with that nerve, &amp;c.

In the year 1542. was made another, and that the laſt application of the Brethren from <hi>Bohemia</hi> unto <hi>Luther;</hi> and it was, not ſo much by Legates, as in the way of a perſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al friendly Viſitation: For <hi>John Auguſta</hi> himſelf, the then chief Antiſtes of the Unity, taking with him of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters <hi>George Iſrael,</hi> and of the Nobility, <hi>Joachimius Proſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bore,</hi> comes to <hi>Witteberg,</hi> to underſtand what hopes there were of the Goſpel-Churches, their receiving and embracing the Diſcipline (which the <hi>Strasburg</hi> Divines had expreſſed themſelves ſo much deſirous of.) They being kindely em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced, relate how the <hi>Huſſian</hi> Churches in <hi>Bohemia</hi> and <hi>Moravia,</hi> being by degrees turned to <hi>Lutheraniſm</hi> (as they call it) retained indeed the Doctrine of the Goſpel; but reformed indeed nothing, as to the endeavour of a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Converſation: That this redounded much to the preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:44083:47"/> of our Churches, ſo well approved of by <hi>Luther</hi> and his Colleagues for the care of Diſcipline: Whileſt the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertines boaſting, that without the yoke of Diſcipline, they could bring it ſo to paſs, to enjoy the Goſpel pure in any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place, ſo that there are none that any more joyn them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to us, yea, and ſome depart from us. They there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore demand, Whether ſo great an abuſe of the Goſpel may be ſuffered? <hi>Luther</hi> replied in the preſence of all the whole Colledge of Divines, <hi>That Popery could not be ſubdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but by rooting out all thoſe uſages which ſavour of the yoke of Humane Superſtition, and violation of the liberty of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; and that at this time eſpecially, when they take notice that all the world is making head againſt them, it muſt needs be granted a matter of neceſſity for us, to withſtand them what we can, and to repair Diſcipline: That, to this end, he would ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly attend the buſineſs, as ſoon as ever he could get any brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing time: For the Pope was at this very time in confident ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of a new Councils making diſturbance in all places, &amp;c. to the like purpoſe.</hi> The Brethren then added, that they could not expect their endeavours ſhould come to any good effect (as they had formerly ſaid in their Letter to <hi>Luther, Anno</hi> 1523.) as long as they ſaw that in their Univerſities and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

After this, when they had had about two weeks moſt familiar converſe, and mutual conference about their whole buſineſs, with <hi>Luther</hi> and the reſt of the Divines; being now ready to return from <hi>Witte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berg, Luther</hi> entertaining them with a feaſt, and in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of many of the Profeſſors of that Univerſity, taking his ſolemn and laſt farwel of them, gave the whole Unity of the Brethren the right hand of holy Fellowſhip, parting with theſe words, <hi>Be you the Apoſtles of</hi> Bohemia, <hi>and I with my Colleagues will be the Apoſtles of</hi> Germany. <hi>Do you the

            <p n="82">82. Some moneths after, the ſame year, <hi>Luther</hi> writing to the ſame <hi>Auguſta,</hi> inſerts theſe words following, <hi>Moreover, I charge you in the Lord, that you hold out with us to the laſt, in the Communion of the Spirit and Doctrine wherein you have begun, and ſtrive with us by word and prayer againſt the Gates of Hell, &amp;c. Commend me, &amp;c. respectfully unto all the Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren in the Lord,</hi> at Strasberg, <hi>the day after S.</hi> Francis: <hi>Anno</hi> 1542.</p>
            <p>This great ſoul'd <hi>Luther</hi> (notwithſtanding all the importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities of the Brethren for the reſtoring of Diſcipline, and the life of Chriſtianity) not at all diſpleaſed with them, perſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in friendly correſpondency with them to the end, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing a gracious dear affection towards them, and toward the buſineſs. <hi>Laſitius</hi> produceth notorious witneſſes, taking from the mouth of <hi>Luther</hi> theſe words following, <hi>There hath not aroſe any people ſince the times of the Apoſtles, whoſe Church hath come nearer to the Apoſtolical Doctrine and Orders, then the Brethren of</hi> Bohemia: and again, <hi>Although theſe Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren in purity of Doctrine excel not us (all the Articles of Faith with us, being ſincerely and purely taken out of the Word of God) yet in the ordinary Diſcipline of the Church which they uſe, and whereby they happily govern the Churches, they go far beyond us, and in this reſpect are far more praiſe-worthy: And we cannot but acknowledge and yield this to them, for the glory of God, and of his truth; whereas our people of</hi> Germany <hi>can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be perſwaded to be willing to take the yoke of Diſcipline upon them.</hi>

Abſolutely, without doubt, this excellent man ſaw the miſchief of the firſt Errour, and was very deſirous it ſhould be amended, but could not (being conſtrained to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide his attendance between this and other conflicts with ſo many monſtrous abominations) ſufficiently diſpatch all things, as true hearted men frequently apologize for him,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:44083:48"/> Yea, and our <hi>Laſitius</hi> himſelf too (as was ſaid before, <hi>Sect.</hi> 77.) and for certain, he commended to God and his Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors prayers and hopes of a further and more perfect de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of Reformation to be attained.

And that all your labour is in vain without it, you may aſſure your ſelves, upon the experience of very many Churches; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they being at the firſt ground-work of Reformation, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to take this wholeſome yoke upon them, could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver after, by any good government, be brought into any order of good life and converſation. Whereupon (and I ſpeak it with much grief) almoſt all things become unſettled, and threatning ruine on every ſide (God bleſs us;) but it is a very grievous miſchief, and the certain decay of the Churches, when the nerve of Diſcipline is wanting therein:
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:44083:51"/> Nor can they be ſaid truly and ſolidly to enjoy and poſſeſs the Goſpel, where either there is no Diſcipline or where it is deſpiſed, and care not taken to keep it up.

There were more then two hundred of the Clergy, and a great appearance of the Patrons, Barons and Nobles: here at that time they created fifteen Miniſters of the Word of God, ſix Conſeniors, and two Biſhops; <hi>viz.

Nor was it much better in this age with the Slavonick Churches in other Nations, we here being oppreſſed with the Papal yoke, they there with the Turkiſh, or elſe overgrown with the manifold ſuperſtitions of the Greek Church.

For whether they believe that we came nearer to the Sanctuary then they, or themſelves nearer then we, as to the way of the purer Diſcipline, it is all a caſe, ſince that we came up nearer to true piety: Truely, they which are ſo regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs of the life of Chriſtianity, muſt look to hear that of Chriſt, <hi>If theſe things were done to the green tree, what ſhall be done to the dry,</hi> Luke 23.31. but and if they are nearer the Sanctuary then we, ſurely then they muſt be attended with greater plagues then we, unleſs they take warning, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent by the means of our example: <hi>For he to whom much is given, muſt be beaten with many ſtripes,</hi> Luke 12, 47, 48.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hus have you had an account of the Sla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vonick Churches, eſpecially that of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> and, the maine of that, the u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of the Brethren of <hi>Bohemia:</hi> to what end, was alſo touched towards the end of the Hiſtory (§. 132, 133, 134.) <hi>viz:</hi> that thoſe, who endeavour the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of Church-affaires, may even from hence be <hi>fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed</hi> with ſome thoughts conducing thereunto. I ſhall now renew my addreſs to you with whom I began, O! you, the Churches of the Britane World. <hi>Amongſt whom</hi> your controverſie about the moſt excellent way of Church-go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment <hi>hath been in agitation</hi> for the ſpace of an entire generation, and that even to the violent ſhaking of the whole State <hi>or Secular government.</hi> Who would have
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:44083:67"/> thought it, that ſuch a queſtion ſo very inconſiderable at firſt ſight, could produce ſo great tempeſts, earth-quakes, and flames. Herein it hath appeared, what the force of zeale is, which is once ſet on fire for God, and Liberty of Conſcience, whether it be right, or wrong: and how <hi>Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſpect</hi> they had need be; that look to hear the whiſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of the ſtill Calme, and the wholſome inſtructions of God himſelf.</p>
            <p>When ever you ſhall once have an opportunity to determine among you this affaire of your ſo great concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, (and it is the Intereſt of whole Chriſtendome to have it rightly determined) You, and <hi>by your means,</hi> the Churches, muſt call upon God, that you all (<hi>viz:</hi> your Pious <hi>David</hi> reſtored to you, with the great Senate now ſitting, and the Eccleſiaſticall Synedrim to be convened, and whoever ſhall be entertained for Counſell in theſe ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred things) may be governed by his holy Spirit, that your Conſultations may have a good iſſue, ſuch as may be for the glory of God, and yours, and the Churches ſalvation: Amen.</p>
            <p>And becauſe God in his ordinary courſe works by ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Means, and truſt on Divine Providence doth not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, but include humane Prudence. It will be needfull, <hi>(after the ſeeking of Grace from above)</hi> that whereſoever any thing of ſober Counſell may be had, it may be prudent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſought out, modeſtly communicated, and diligently pondered, that ſo at laſt in the depth of wiſdome, that which is found moſt excellent, may be choſen, decreed, and ſetled. Nor can there be wanting hope of good ſucceſs, when it once appears, that you are willing ſeriouſly to tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe the buſineſs, not to huddle it over, but, to heare the many preparatory deliberations, (both thoſe at home, and elſewhere offered) and then after all things be truly <hi>ſifted,</hi> to come to a Concluſion. For the ſighs of holy men unto God for you will not be wanting, as alſo, nei<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <pb n="3" facs="tcp:44083:67"/>
            <p>Now, <hi>becauſe</hi> the Catholick Church is one, whereof we are Citizens, even all that beleeve in Chriſt, in whatſoever particular Churches, or Nations they be diſperſed: Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of Saints requireth, that, upon occaſion we make a common Collection of deſires, and prayers, votes, and judgments, for the comfort and advantages of undertakings for the common good. In confidence hereof I though a Stranger, have yet adventured to ſpeak my mind, and yet not mine, but the Judgment of my Church, and of ſome pious wiſe men, Luminaries of the Church, which have given Teſtimony to the Conſtitution of Affairs amongſt us, as they were, <hi>viz:</hi> that this way of Church-government, is the very ſame which Chriſt inſtituted, and Apoſtles uſed; or elſe the neareſt to it, and therefore 'tis to be wiſhed it were ſetled in all Churches. (See the premiſed Hiſtory, §. 76. 79. 80. 82. 85. 90. 94. 96. 106. 107. 108. 111. 112. 113. 115. 122.) But is it ſo indeed?</p>
            <p>We boaſt not of Perfection, which we know is not to be found on this ſide Heaven; neither doe we prefer our ſelves before others, being conſcious of our own defects. But that we may not be wanting to the Cauſe we have un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken, (and verily that which is <hi>any where</hi> good ought to be made common) we ſay they which have given their approbation of this Church-government may ſeem not to have been deceived: in that, Firſt, ſo reverend men, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not eaſily be ſaid to want Judgment, nor yet to be led aſide by affection, ſuch as ſought to pleaſe ſome obſcure perſons in the World, giving us juſt cauſe to fear, that in extolling ſuch, they did the rather impaire their own reputation. This is evident in <hi>Eraſmus</hi> (Hiſt. 70.)</p>
            <p>Yea, and if any man will but ſeriouſly weigh theſe things in the ballance of his own Judgment, he will ſcarce evade his being of the ſame mind: <hi>Viz.</hi> If he conſiders, <hi>[a]</hi> that not any one, but many began this Unity, (<hi>Hiſtor.</hi> 45. <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not.</hi> p. 78.) <hi>[b]</hi> and theſe not lead by ſelf conceit, but the zeale of ſalvation; <hi>[c]</hi> not out of <hi>luxuriancy</hi> of wit,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:44083:68"/> but ſenſible and tender conſcience, <hi>(ibid) [d]</hi> not preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitantly, but with manifold deliberations for many years; (<hi>Hiſt.</hi> 47.99.) <hi>[e]</hi> not with preſumptuous confidence of themſelves, but with fear and trembling, making many and heart-breaking Prayers to God to this purpoſe, (48.50.60.) <hi>[f]</hi> and with great reſpect had to <hi>Judicious</hi> men, ſeeking counſell, whereever any could be hoped or looked for: The <hi>Romans, Greeks, Waldenſes, Huſſites, Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therans,</hi> &amp;c. (61.66.68.) <hi>[g]</hi> alſo with full purpoſe to try all things, and hold faſt that which was <hi>any where found</hi> good; inſomuch as they ordained it a Canon among themſelves, if any appeared any where better reformed, they would be obliged to <hi>joyne themſelves</hi> to them: (67.) In no wiſe therefore doth this Unity ſavour at all of Schiſm. <hi>[h]</hi> Now all this while, whatever they had collected among them, they ſo diligently and cloſely ſtuck thereunto in their practiſe, that it may be ſaid to be throughly prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the fire of Perſecution for the ſpace of two generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons without interruption. Neither yet hath any thing to this day been found, which is better, <hi>viz.</hi> more conſonant to the Scriptures, and the practiſe of the Apoſtles, or more for the ſatisfaction of the Conſcience.</p>
            <p>But moreover, we want not for theſe things more weighty, and as it were demonſtrative Arguments: As Firſt, that this Church of the Brethren hath <hi>all along</hi> been ſuch a body, as the Apoſtle would have the body of the whole Church to be; a <hi>Conjunction</hi> of Saints, by the work of the Miniſtry for mutuall edification in the Unity of faith, and unto the exerciſe of unfeigned Charity fitly framed together and compact, by that which every joynt ſupplyes, from the inward working power (<hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.12.) for here, all are in this manner (ſome being members of others) knit together, by common Lawes unto common edification: not by the charmes of any outward Splendor, Wealth, or Honour, or chaines of any compulſory violence, but ſet together only by the inward working power
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:44083:68"/> and glew of the ſame Faith, Love, and Hope.</p>
            <p>Secondly, becauſe ſuch a Polity, as is that of the Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren-Church, is of that nature; that however it ſubmits it ſelf to the Polities of the World, yea to all men for good, yet it will loſe nothing of that Church-liberty, which Chriſt hath purchaſed for it with his own blood, (as Mr. <hi>Olevian</hi> obſerves <hi>Hiſt.</hi> 115.) and which is more that it alwayes comports with every well-conſtituted State, and never diſturbs it, (that which is altogether to be wiſhed, ſeeing that the State, and the Church, both combining for the welfare of humane Society, muſt dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer only as Outward and Inward.) For ſuch a Church-go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment as this is <hi>ſutable</hi> to a Monarchical State, becauſe it hath Epiſcopacy; to an Ariſtocratical, becauſe it hath a Senate; to a Democratical, becauſe it hath Synods. Therefore <hi>Calvin,</hi> and <hi>Bucer</hi> (both for the Order of the Brethren, <hi>Hiſt.</hi> 79, 80.) being called unto divers Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to reform the Churches, each of them ſo applied him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, that he accommodated with the Secular government: <hi>Calvin</hi> in the Commonwealth (of <hi>Geneva</hi>) conſtituting a Presbyterie. <hi>Bucer</hi> in the Kingdom (of <hi>England</hi>) leaving there (what he found) Epiſcopacy to continue, and remain. But whether or no they did well to part aſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, things which when joyned together have a better operation, thoſe thence ariſing, (and unto ſo much miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief among the Brethren moleſting) controverſies and contentions give <hi>too much</hi> evidence. Perhaps if they had hearkned to that of <hi>Solomon,</hi> a threefold cord is hardly broken, they would not have had ſo much ſad experience of thoſe breaches.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Another Argument of much validity for ſuch a Form of Church-government as this is: It carries within it ſelf, antidotes againſt the evils which may annoy it, <hi>viz.</hi> Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and Diſcipline, whereby it either prevents diſorders, or elſe, if they ſteal in, ſuppreſſes them, <hi>v. g.

            <p>Beſides, the Apoſtle pronounceth thoſe Churches bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed where the ſervants of God are received as the Angels of God, yea as Chriſt Jeſus himſelf (<hi>Gal.</hi> 4.14, 15.)

            <p>If I had ſcope, I might write a large Commentary, how Chriſt founded that ſpiritual Kingdom of his (which he is pleaſed to have in the World indeed, but not of the World) and how it was adminiſtred by the Apoſtle; the eaſier to let you ſee the enormities of thoſe Chriſtians, which diſ-figure this ſpiritual and celeſtial Kingdom, by tranſ-figuring of it into ſo many, worldly, earthly, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreal and carnal Forms, and what <hi>good</hi> hath <hi>at any time</hi> to this day been done, or not done, by ſo many new tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formations and reformations, but I may not dilate my ſelf. I therefore bend my knees to the Father of our Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, that for the riches of his glory he would give you to be ſtrengthened with might in the inner man, by his Spirit, that being rooted in love, you may comprehend with all Saints, what is the breadth, and length, and depth, and heighth; and to know the Love of Chriſt which paſſeth knowledge, that you may be filled, even unto all the fulneſs of God. (<hi>Epheſ.</hi> 3.14.)</p>
            <p>Some may ſay, by ſo much extolling the ſtate of your affairs, what would you have? would you perſwade us to them? I anſwer, If theſe things be good, ſurely they are communicative of themſelves, and that they ſhould be made common, ought not to be matter of <hi>diſpleaſure,</hi> but deſire; and if it be well with my ſoul, I cannot but
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:44083:70"/> ſay with <hi>Paul,</hi> I would to God, you were all as I am, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting theſe bonds of my Affliction (<hi>Acts</hi> 29.29.) I ſeek nothing herein for my Church which now is not, nor for my ſelf which am entring upon my grave: But for thee, O Catholick Church, the Mother of us all; whom I ſo love, and reverence, that I cannot but wiſh, it were ſtill better with thee, whereever, however, and in what part ſoever it may be better. I was not born to be facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, nor have I lived ſuch, nor will I dye ſuch, but will adhere to Chriſt only, together with them which he hath given to be my guides, or whereof he hath made me guide. I would it were given to all that call on the name of Chriſt to perſwade the ſame thing, that having Chriſt (only Chriſt, bare Chriſt) for their leader, they may not know <hi>Paul, Apollo, Cephas,</hi> or any whomſoever; and fixing to themſelves the mark of that one ſalvation, and eternal glory, they may ſuperſede other vanities, (contentions about Primacy, Predominancy, Titles, Revenues, as worldly impertinent vile rubbiſh.)</p>
            <p>But dare you ſo mean a Perſon move ſuch things? I anſw. Give me leave to indulge my grief, which conſumes my bones, for the ruine of my Church, and the Fear of yours. I ſay the ruine of the Church, both mine, which is now already in its rubbiſh, and yours, which is in great danger unleſs the tender mercies of God prevent you. O Chriſtians, the love of Chriſt, and the deſire of the common ſalvation compels me <hi>thus to ſpeak unto you.</hi> I do that which <hi>Job</hi> did, when caſt on the dunghill, ſaying to his friends about him, I teach you being exerciſed by the ſtroke of God upon me, <hi>Job</hi> 27.11. If I take the boldneſs ſo to exhort you, I adventure upon no more then is enjoyned a duty to all Chriſtians; (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.31. <hi>&amp;</hi> 2.13, 11. <hi>&amp; Heb.</hi> 3.13.) ſhould I give counſel too? yea; by the ſame Law <hi>with</hi> that very poor Citizen, and of no account, who yet, his countrey being in danger was bound if he knew any thing, to bring relief thereunto by
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:44083:70"/> counſell, (<hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 9.17.) and with that Maid-ſervant which durſt counſel her Lord, the General, 2 <hi>Kings.</hi> 5.3. Hear ye me which fear God; my words ſhall not be wind, but ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, they ſhall not utter any private matter, but that of the common ſalvation.</p>
            <p>I well know the <hi>Genius</hi> of humane nature, how inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent it is to every one of us to pleaſe himſelf in his own, and to deſpiſe others in compariſon with himſelf. The Cedars will admire their heigth, the Oakes their ſtrength, the Palm their handſomneſs, the Figs, and Vines their fruit, but the Whin is contemned for its ſhrubbedneſs, that even the beaſts of the field can tread it under their feet, (<hi>Judg.</hi> 9.) <hi>Be it then</hi> that the <hi>Bohemian</hi> Nation were the leaſt of Nations, the <hi>Bohemian</hi> Church the leaſt of Churches, and the <hi>Bohemian</hi> Church of the Brethren, the leaſt part of that Country: what then will follow? that he that is great can learn nothing of a little man? hear Chriſt, that Eternal Wiſdom, what did he when the great Apoſtles contended for the Prerogative of greatneſs in the Kingdom of Heaven? he takes a little child, and ſetting him in the midſt, ſaid; <hi>Verily I ſay unto you, unleſs you be converted, and become as a little child, you ſhall not enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Kingdom of Heaven,</hi> (Mat. 18.1, 2, 3.) Make application thereof, and you ſhall be your own teachers, O ye great Doctors! I hope you all believe, that Chriſt is ſtill with us, and will be to the end of the World, to behold our behaviour, and to hear our contentions about <hi>greatneſs</hi> yet continuing. Nor muſt there be wanting ſome little ones, to be ſet in the midſt of the Great ones, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to be their pattern.</p>
            <p>Contend then O Great Churches, among your ſelves if you pleaſe, about the Preheminence! whether the <hi>Grecian,</hi> or the <hi>Roman;</hi> the <hi>French,</hi> or the <hi>Engliſh;</hi> the <hi>German,</hi> or <hi>Helvetian be the greater</hi> Church? ſtrive about <hi>the notion of</hi> faith, for Ceremonies, or Hierarchy, as fiercely as you can: Behold Chriſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents

            <p>And what elſe, did the Apoſtle inculcate on his <hi>factious Corinthians;</hi> ſtriving about fading to yes, and that even be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Infidels. If we have (ſaith he) any caſes of things per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining to this life to judge, why ſet you not them to judge who are leaſt eſteemed in the Church; I ſpeak it to your ſhame, 1 <hi>Cor:</hi> 6.4. What if the ſame Apoſtle to our ſhame ſhould ſay even to you (as there to them) O! O you (Corinthians!) that are wiſe, that are rich, that raign without us: (<hi>ver.</hi> 4, 8.) For truly the things for which you contend, are only of this life. Rank, Eminency, Poſſeſſions, Revenues, Authority, Repute, and the like Prerogatives, but how ſmall a thing is <hi>all</hi> this for you, which ſhall judge the world (<hi>v:</hi> 2. &amp; 3.) which, are in expectation of the Throne of Chriſt; and his bleſſed Kingdom to Eternity (<hi>Apoc.</hi> 3.21.) So that, whilſt you that are ſo great contend about things ſo ſmall, behold God ſets before you ſome that are contemptible, and of
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:44083:71"/> the loweſt form, that you may begin even of them to learn to do better. Thoſe I mean which groaning under Chriſt's Croſs, may thus addreſs to you that ſhine in glory. God hath ſet forth unto you <hi>us</hi> as appointed unto death: for we are made a ſpectacle unto the world, to Angels, and to men, we are fools for Chriſt, and you are wiſe in Chriſt, we are weak, but you are ſtrong, ye are honourable, but we are vilified, to this very time we both hunger, and thirſt, and are naked; and buffeted, and have no certain dwelling place, and labour working with our own hands; being reviled, we bleſs, being made as the filth of the World, and the off-ſcouring of all things, &amp;c. (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.9, &amp;c.)</p>
            <p>Thus <hi>Paul</hi> minds them of theſe things in 1 Epiſt. to <hi>Cor.</hi> and what heed they gave to him herein, appears in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Epiſtle, where he once, and again reproves them, that they deſpiſed his Apoſtolical meanneſs, and ſuffered them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be led <hi>away</hi> from the ſimplicity of Chriſt, by them which were addicted to pomp, and great ſwelling words, and full fed with large fat morſels, and no wonder, for ſo it was with the <hi>Lord</hi> of the Prophets and Apoſtles, that by reaſon of this meanneſs, and meekneſs, (<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

For the fooliſhneſs of God is wiſer then men, and the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God is ſtronger then men; I God making choice of thoſe things which are baſe to the world, and nothing worth; yea even thoſe things which are not, to aboliſh thoſe that are, that no fleſh might glory in his ſight, (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.28, 29.)</p>
            <p>However then I heartily wiſh you (O! you great <hi>Stick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers</hi> in the great Churches) ſome great <hi>Joſeph,</hi> which may beſpeak his brethren with authority, why fall ye out

(2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29.11.) Or elſe a great <hi>Conſtantine</hi> who gently reproving his Biſhops the Miniſters of Chriſt, burned all the books of <hi>controverſies.</hi> Yet, what forbids, that I ſhould not tread in the footſteps of Chriſt? and ſetting before you, great Apoſtles, a little child in the midſt, and ſhew you, what leſſon you <hi>muſt</hi> learn of him. What hinders alſo, but that the Apoſtles counſel may be urged, that quarrel being ariſen among you about thoſe things which concern this life only, the judgement hereof may be committed to them that are the loweſt in the Church?

            <p>In confidence then of this Divine right, the <hi>Bohemian,</hi> though the leaſt of <hi>all</hi> Churches, and oppreſſed, intreats You, <hi>the</hi> Churches of greater Magnitude, to ſuperſede your contentions about matters ſo ſmall, ſo fading, and of no value. What? will you contend for the Prerogative of Place, and dignity? when Chriſt did ſo ſtraightly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid his own, all deſire of honour, and commanded, that he that affected the primacy ſhould be thruſt back to the laſt place (<hi>Mat.</hi> 20.26. &amp;. 23.11, 12.) for titles? when the meekeſt Lord condemned the Phylacteries in the Phariſees as a piece of ſtinking pride, (<hi>ib.</hi> 5.) and would have his own count themſelves ſufficiently honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the mutual compellation of Brethren: (<hi>ver.</hi> 8.) Do you ſtrive about the higher underſtanding of the Myſteries? when we are here, all but infants, ſcarce un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding the leaſt part of that which by the goodneſs of God we ſhall know, when we come to the ſtate of
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:44083:72"/> Perfection. Why may not the one of them that have an imperfection in ſpeech, have a good underſtanding of the other, or at leaſt bare with him? Doe you contend for the right of Prebends? when Chriſt affirmes it better to give then to receive, (<hi>Act.</hi> 20.) and interdicts all his own, which he ſent forth to preach the Goſpel, the charge of the purſe (<hi>Math.</hi> 10.9.) ſubjoyning this rule, <hi>ye have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived freely, give freely:</hi> And verily that was matter of glorying to the Apoſtles, that they preached the Goſpel <hi>gratis,</hi> (even to the richeſt <hi>Corinthians</hi>) that they might not be burdenſome to any (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.7. &amp; 9.) and it was the Character of a mercenary Preacher to ſtrive to be rich of the Goſpel. (<hi>ib.</hi> 20. and elſewhere often) Let the ſincere <hi>Servants</hi> of Chriſt then, imitating Chriſt, and the Succeſſors of the Apoſtles treading in the ſteps of the Apoſtles, glory in the Lord.</p>

Verily, <hi>bigneſs</hi> is of no vertue, (unleſs happily to ſink with its own weight) all action flowes from the forme. My Predeceſſors did adventure in the contentions of the Brethren of the Evangelici (in <hi>Germany, Helvetia, Polonia,</hi>) in a brotherly way to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, and by the aſſiſtance of God, did there doe ſome good.

For you, O Chriſtian people, how variouſly, how furiouſly, how perniciouſly you are divided, Heaven, and Earth can witneſs. I ſpeak not of the diſſentions of diverſe Nations, Cities, Families only, but even of the fallings of, and fall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings out of the ſame Nations, Cities, Families, ſo many wayes amongſt themſelves as is elſewhere ſcarce to be pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralleld; as if you deſignedly had conſpired to act contrary to what Chriſt hath commanded, that we ſhould be one. Mark, I beſeech you, what <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith: If the whole Church come together, and all ſpeak with Tongues, (as being taught of God ſtrange <hi>Tongues</hi>) and the Idiots or unbeleevers come in, will they not ſay you are mad? (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.23.) But what then would they ſay <hi>or doe,</hi> if they could now ſee the whole Church conſiſting of ſo many Chriſtian Nations and parties met in one place; and all theſe quarrelling, biting, ſlaſhing, and cutting of one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers fingers, hands, feet, heads, would not the unbeleevers ſay we were hurryed by <hi>infernall</hi> Furies? And is it not thus? verily, this laſt Age, all the desks of Schools, and Pulpits of Churches doe nothing but contend, and create moſt bitter grudges againſt one another; ſo many railing and reproaching writings flying up and down in publick againſt one another, as that the World at this day cannot bare. All the Nations in <hi>Europe</hi> hath done nothing for more then 40 years, but what the <hi>Midianites</hi> of old did, when they were put into a frenzy at the ſound of <hi>Gideons</hi> Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets:
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:44083:73"/> Every mans ſword being ſet againſt his fellow, they run one another through, and ſo fall by their own mutuall wounds, without the hand of any other adverſary. The Jewes and Turks ſee all theſe things and laugh; wondering how we ſhould thus be given up to a reprobate ſenſe, that ere their ſword comes to touch us, we diſpatch our ſelves with our own weapons, and then leave the reſt of us to be a prey to them. Thus did <hi>Solyman</hi> the Turkiſh Emperour laugh at us to our reproach and ſhame: who having taken from the Chriſtians 40 Kingdomes in <hi>Europe</hi> and <hi>Aſia,</hi> when it was told him, that the Chriſtian Kings and Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths had entred into a League between themſelves, and were about to prepare War againſt him: Holding up his hand, and <hi>dividing and changing</hi> his fingers, ſaith he, as much as I fear that theſe my fingers will grow together, ſo much the uniting of the Chriſtians together: and ſo it was, for to ſtop the inundation of the victories of their then common Enemy, they could not agree among themſelves, nor yet can; but to overthrow themſelves they alwaies agree: Eſpecially of late, and with the greateſt rage of all, theſe laſt forty years, wherein ſo much Chriſtian blood hath been ſhed by the Chriſtians themſelves, as was never in the memory of man ſpilt by a Forreign Enemy, There is every where made ſuch havock of Chriſtian Kingdoms, that we may cry out with the Prophet, <hi>If the Lord of Hoſt had not left us a ſeed, we had been as Sodome and Gomorrah.</hi> Alas! Alas! Alas!</p>
            <p>But O Chriſtians! are theſe things the ſhewing forth of your vertues to the praiſe of him that hath called you into his marvellous light? as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the account whereof, he calleth you, a choſen Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, a royal Prieſthood, an holy Nation, and a people which God challengeth peculia<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>And what do you Miniſters of the Goſpel, Maſters of the Chriſtian people, whom Chriſt hath ſent to call his Elect out of the World? hath he taught you to bring his people up to this? <hi>Diogenes</hi> the Philoſopher ſeeing an youth carrying himſelf uncivilly, ſtruck his Maſter, (ſaith he) do you teach him no better manners then ſo?

Woe to the Paſtors, which feed themſelves, eating the fat, and wearing the fleece, killing the beſt, and yet not feeding the flock, not ſtrengthening the weak, not healing the ſick, not binding up the broken, neither have ye brought again that which was driven away, nor ſought up that which was loſt, but with force and cruelty have ye Lorded it over my ſheep, &amp;c. As ſure as I live ſaith the Lord, I will require my ſheep at your hands, and cauſe you to ceaſe from feeding your ſelves; for you generally for the moſt part, (as ſure as the Lord lives) feed not, but only your ſelves, and there is no ſerious care of the ſalvation of your people taken by you.

None of you is meek in ſpirit, humble, and yielding to others, but you muſt have all yield to your ſelves, and who then ſhall learn Chriſtians meekneſs, and obedience?

Do you never begin from your High Pinnacle (where God hath placed you as in <hi>the</hi> ſupreme watch-tower) to take a proſpect of humane affairs, to ſee what may be mended?

            <p>If ever were the time that you would be watchful, O Chriſtians! now is your time to watch; O! for the ſake of the living God look about you! that he would pleaſe to turn our heart to our Fathers, and our Affairs to that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition wherein it was in the beginning; that the Lord may not come and ſmite the earth with a curſe, <hi>Mal.</hi> 4. <hi>ult.</hi>

God ſwears he never commanded them, nor hath it at all come into his heart; and therefore that he will diſſipate all theſe things, and overturn all with his ſword, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Jer. 16.4.</p>
            <p>There was in the year 1529. made in <hi>Germany,</hi> a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation of the Princes and Eſtates, againſt an Edict which came forth againſt Liberty of Conſcience; whence it is that even to this day the title of Proteſtants is given to the Evangelici: but behold, 'tis now 130 years ſince; and yet there is not wanting juſt cauſe of Proteſting againſt ſuch as tyrannize over the conſciences of men! not only thoſe, which then, as now, deſigning to reigne <hi>alone,</hi> would not ſuffer any ſo much as to mutter; but at this day, againſt you the very Proteſtants themſelves, that even you alſo have filled all places with mutual violences, and ſo you are doing ſtill; whileſt you are all zealous for Liberty of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, yet you are all in oppoſition againſt it among your ſelves; no man enduring to tolerate another, which differs never ſo little from himſelf. Alas! what will become of us? Shall it alwayes be that our proteſtations contradict out practiſes? What if God himſelf ſhould enter a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation againſt us all? That Chriſtians are no Chriſtians, becauſe they do not <hi>keep the Commands</hi> of Chriſt; that Catholicks are no Catholicks, becauſe they ſeek not the welfare of <hi>All,</hi> but of themſelves only; that the Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelici are no Evangelici, becauſe they live contrary to the rule of the Goſpel; that the Reformed are not Reformed, becauſe going about to diſtinguiſh themſelves by Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, they differ not in their converſation. Alas! We are all out of the way: I alſo and my people: Wo to us if we reform not.</p>
            <p>Now God that he may frame us unto this Reformation, doth not only proteſt in his Word, <hi>Hear ye Heavens, and

(<hi>Jon.</hi> 1.5.) We all are as this <hi>Jonas,</hi> diſobedient to God, by reaſon of whom, the <hi>Depths</hi> of God's wrath are <hi>ſtirred up,</hi> even now ready to ſwallow up the ſhip of all Chriſtendom, <hi>although</hi> that of <hi>Jonas</hi> eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped: For there, though they were ſuch as worſhipped <hi>other</hi> gods; yet in the common jeopardy, they were all in common turned to their prayers, every one calling upon his god (<hi>v.</hi> 5.) We that worſhip but one God, even the very jawes of death cannot bring us generally to turn to God; but ſome ſcreeking, others are ſhouting, ſome periſhing, others are making merry; Alas! for the general confuſion in our ſhip. And which is more, there we finde <hi>Jonas</hi> confeſſing his fault, and the reſt, for the ſafety of whom, he <hi>doomed</hi> himſelf to be caſt away, not haſty to caſt him over-board, but ſeeking rather, if by any means they might ſave him: (<hi>v.</hi> 10.) But we <hi>imputing</hi> the cauſe of the Tempeſt one to the other, furiouſly poſt to deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction every one his fellow, whom he can: Alas! there, to get the ſhip to the ſhore, and ſave the nocent with the innocent, they all work as for life: (<hi>v.</hi> 13.) But with us, ſome ſweating at it even while they faint, others do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, others again taking the Oars from them that would rowe, others again if they ſeem willing to ſtir, yet ſome of them rowe this way, others that way, all confuſed, there being nothing but tumults, brawlings, fightings; ſome being ſo ſtark mad, that they make <hi>holes</hi> in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon bottome, reſolving, that they may ſee others periſh, to caſt away themſelves, Alas, Alas!</p>
            <p>What will become of us if we go on to take this courſe?
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:44083:77"/> of neceſſity the ſhip wherein we all are muſt needs be loſt; whether by the waves coming upon her from without, and we be overwhelmed by the invaſion of the heathen Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; or from within by our ſelves, being thus enraged unto our own mutual deſtruction. Wo to thee O ſhip of the Church, that thou haſt ſuch Ship-maſters, ſuch Oars, ſuch Pilots; God change our mindes, and deliver us from this madneſs.</p>
            <p>But then what counſel or hope is there? Much hope in the mercy of God, if men would hearken to wholſome counſel? what is that? Such as we finde in <hi>Jonas</hi>'s ſhip now ready to be caſt away, but <hi>yet ſaved,</hi> and in the City of <hi>Nineveh,</hi> now ready to be overthrown, but yet ſtanding: Firſt, that every offender, with <hi>Jonah,</hi> ſhould awake, and acknowledging his offence, humbly yeild himſelf up to the Abyſſe of God's judgements; perhaps by the ſame labour he may ſave others from periſhing, and himſelf alſo may finde mercy: And then, that the Pilots of this ſhip, the Heads of the Chriſtian world, taking counſel together a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong themſelves for the common ſalvation, order all things well, whereby <hi>God may be reconciled,</hi> and <hi>man</hi> may be <hi>brought</hi> into order: And laſt of all, that the whole people, ſtirred up by the good example, and warning of their Superiours, would ſuffer themſelves to be reduced, and brought home again as to God, and goodneſs, unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſly calling upon God, as they did both in the ſhip, and in <hi>Nineveh;</hi> and leaving nothing undone, nor giving over, what ever it is, whereby, they returning into peace with God, and one another, may take Oars, all as one man, and ſtrain all the ſinews of their endeavours, <hi>to arrive</hi> at the Haven of Deliverance.</p>
            <p>But to come nearer the buſineſs, there are four Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal points of the Churches ſafety, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <list>
               <item>1. That the whole Chriſtian People unite together.</item>
               <item>2. That they be likewiſe brought into order.</item>
               <item>3. That they knit together with the bands of Diſciples.</item>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:44083:77"/>
               <item>4. And then be filled with the Spirit of life.</item>
            </list>
            <p>Firſt, Let them unite, I ſay, that they be not any more as ſcattered ſheep, or a flock of Lyons, Bears, Wolves, Serpents, and Baſilisks, devouring one another: but (as 'tis promiſed) peaceably lying down, and feeding together, the tame or gentle, with the wilde; the ſtrong with the weak, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as one Flock under one Shepherd; and yet not one ſo as a flock of Cattle, where all are alike one with another, but as an Army <hi>well ordered,</hi> (Cant. 6.3.) as the Kingdom of the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> which was better governed then that of <hi>Solomon,</hi> (1 <hi>Kings</hi> 9. <hi>&amp;</hi> 10.) as the City of the great King, (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 48.3.) as the Houſe of God, (1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.15.) Laſtly, as the living body, perfectly ſet with its va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious members, for various offices, and put together with all the joynts, and all full of the Spirit of life, (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.12. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.14. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) without which the reſt (as union, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, connexion) are all in vain; for let the parts and number of them be full, and ſet comely in their proper places, and well knit together, yet the body wanting only the ſoul, is nothing elſe but a carkaſs.</p>
            <p>O you Chriſtian people, diſperſed through <hi>Europe, Aſia, Africa, America,</hi> and the Iſlands of the Sea, into ſo many Religions, Sects, Opinions, and multiplyed different Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies, what elſe I pray are you now become, but as thoſe bones of Iſrael in <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> ſcattered abroad in the field of the world, (<hi>Ezek.</hi> 37.1, 2.) O! that it would pleaſe God to bring on that day, wherein he will put forth his omnipotent power <hi>among you;</hi> to <hi>command</hi> that there may be a noiſe and a ſhaking, that ſo the bones may draw near one to another, and come together (<hi>v.</hi> 7. this would be the union) <hi>Every one,</hi> the one to the other, (even in his order) the ſinews knitting all together, the fleſh coming upon them, and the skin covering them over (<hi>v.</hi> 8. there would be the bands) and then the breath come from the four winds, to inſpire all that are ſpiritually dead, that they may live (<hi>v.</hi> 9, 10.) <hi>viz.</hi> the life of Chriſt, and who ſhall live when God doth this? <hi>Num.</hi> 24.23.</p>
            <pb n="24" facs="tcp:44083:78"/>
            <p>You vainly wiſh, may ſome ſay, things impoſſible, and which can never come to paſs; and yet we muſt wiſh what ever is good; and the holy Spirit teacheth us <hi>ſo to do (Pſal.</hi> 122.) that Jeruſalem be one City well built, a City compact and put together every way within its ſelf; (<hi>v.</hi> 3.) where all the Tribes of the Lord go up together with one accord, to praiſe the Name of the Lord; (<hi>v.</hi> 4.) where there is ſet the Tribunal (of Chriſt, <hi>v.</hi> 5.) to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve peace and proſperity, as well within the walls, as in the Palaces; (<hi>v.</hi> 6, 7.) where all the Citizens of the Church are brethren, and friends in perfect peace, (<hi>v.</hi> 8.) ſtudious to ſeek and procure the common good: (<hi>v.</hi> 9.) he is therefore no good Citizen of the Church, that doth not ſeek, or at leaſt deſire and wiſh the common good thereof.</p>
            <p>Every man ſeeks after that which he loves, they ſay. I therefore, becauſe God hath enamoured me with the love, 1. Of Unity, eſpecially that of the Church. 2. Of Order, eſpecially in the Church. 3. Of Settlement, eſpecially of the Church. 4. Life and Vigour, eſpecially of the Church, cannot but be in purſuit of thoſe things with all my deſires, and having loſt the leſs, our Unity, Order, Bands, Life, I cannot but pray for the greater, even the Unity, Order, Bands, and Life of the whole people of Chriſtendome, in as much as Unity in the Community, is far better then community in paucity.</p>
            <p>I would ſome greater and more famous Church, which is as a City ſet upon an hill, (<hi>Mat.</hi> 5.14.) yea, lifted up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the Hills, (<hi>Joſ.</hi> 2.2.) would begin, and ſet an exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to the reſt: I mean of perfect co-implantation, perfect <hi>Co-ordination,</hi> perfect connexion, and perfect reformation, after the life of Chriſt, as much as may be on this ſide heaven; for in theſe doth the perfection, beauty, and ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the Church conſiſt.</p>
            <p>We ought to pray for the Unity of the Church, becauſe he, which could not deſire but that which was beſt, even he who is our Saviour, ſanctifying himſelf to be a
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:44083:78"/> Sacrifice for us, prayed for this, and that with tears: <hi>Father, I ſanctifie my ſelf for theſe, that they alſo may be ſanctified in thy Truth,</hi> (Joh. 17.19.) <hi>even all, that ſhall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in me:</hi> (20.) <hi>That they all may be One, as thou Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther art in me, and I in thee, and that they may be One in <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s</hi> (21.) <hi>I have given them the glory, which thou gaveſt to me, that they may be One, even as alſo We are One:</hi> (22.) <hi>I in them, and thou in me, that they may be made perfect in One, and the world may know that thou haſt ſent me.</hi> (23.) Alas! Chriſtians, be afraid! having loſt Unity, we have loſt that, whereby the world ſhould know, that we are God's people, and that Chriſt was ſent of the Father to be the Saviour of the world; had we kept this, we might have gained a thouſand worlds; O then, that yet, yet we may return unto Unity, that the world may know, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But what Unity do you deſire? Even that which the Apoſtles began by the Command, and Example of Chriſt, under whom the Church was one Heart, and one Soul, <hi>Acts</hi> 4.32. <hi>i. e.</hi> there was no ſtudy to make and maintain parties, but the ſame ſentiment and conſent in all, and the ſame deſigne of common edification (as among the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the ſame body.) O that God would pleaſe ſo to give to us, one heart and one ſoul, that all the Paſtors with their ſeveral Flocks, and all the Flocks with their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Paſtors, the whole Clergie among themſelves, and the people among themſelves, all, the Rulers with their ſubjects, and ſubjects with their Rulers, and every Church with it ſelf, and all the Churches of the ſame Kingdom and Province within themſelves, may all be but one body, and one ſoul.</p>
            <p>Open but your eyes, O Chriſtians! how without Unity, there is in the very foundation of the whole Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick of the Church, no ſtrength at all, but all to <hi>tumble,</hi> and running to ruine. In all things Natural, Artificial, and Moral, the only Baſe of Peace and Proſperity, is U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, unto which all things, firſt, and laſt, above, and
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:44083:79"/> below, on the right and left hand, muſt be ſo reduced, that if one goes, all go: In ſuch a frame hath God made the world, and all and every thing in the world, to wit, the body of every living creature, (yea, and every Plant too) hanging together ſtill with certain ligaments in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry part. To the like form of neceſſity muſt all humane Society (and the Church alſo) be reduced; becauſe where ever multitude is, there is confuſion, unleſs that multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude (by vertue of Order) be brought to an Unity; break but Unity, it's unpoſſible but that the multitude ſhould fall in pieces, and ſo to ruine: For it cannot be otherwiſe, but that plurality (not united together with the band of Union) muſt come to diviſion, and from diviſion to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, and from contention to confuſion.</p>
            <p n="2">2. But Unity is not enough for the full ſafety of the Church, and therefore Order muſt be added; becauſe the Church is not a Body made up of Similar parts (all of like nature and name with themſelves and the whole) as an heap of Sand, or a <hi>ſtack</hi> of Wood, or a flock of Sheep, or the body of a Snail, where 'tis not enough that the parts are together; but ſuch as conſiſts of divers members of diſtinct places, ſcituations, forms, and offices; as we ſee in a Houſe, City, Army, and the Humane body; where every thing, the top, and the bottome, the end, and the end, the middle, and the middle, according to their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, contains it ſelf in its own place, and acts what it hath in ſpecial charge in its own ſphere: and it muſt be thus, or elſe all is in a deſpairing caſe.</p>
            <p>But what Order do we wiſh in the Churches? Such a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain as Chriſt hath inſtituted, and the Apoſtles obſerved, <hi>viz.</hi> That there ſhould be ſome to govern, and go before, and ſome to follow and obey, in a legitimate ſubordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <hi>of the loweſt to the higheſt:</hi> and eſpecially, that every one abide in the Calling wherewith he is called, not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaking his ſtation, nor intrenching upon anothers, (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7, 17.) Chriſt hath ſet us an example herein; who (exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:44083:79"/> the Office of a Prophet in his life, of a Prieſt in his death, and of a King in heaven) whilſt he was yet in the exerciſe of his Prophetical Office, and they would make him a King, he declined it; (<hi>John</hi> 6.15.) they would have him take upon him to diſtribute outward poſſeſſions, he refuſed it, (<hi>Luke</hi> 12.14.) and he commanded the like to his Apoſtles, not to intermeddle with ſecular affairs, (<hi>Luke</hi> 22.26.) It is then confuſion in the Church, when perſons called to Eccleſiaſtical Offices, ſhall entangle themſelves in Civil Miniſtrations, Poſſeſſions, Dominions, Judgments, Wars, or contrariwiſe hereto. Of the former way of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion, all ſee a plain inſtance in the Papacy; where Church-men having gotten into their hands the power of both ſwords, exerciſe Spiritual and Secular Government. Of the latter, they which are any thing well-ſighted, may ſee it true in part of the Reformed Churches; where thoſe of the Civil Power have forced away the power of the Spiritual Sword, out of the hands of the Paſtors of the Church, and do not indulge them the exerciſe hereof. To this purpoſe <hi>Olevian</hi> that godly Divine, hath an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation, which gives me occaſion to give a ſeaſonable and uſeful warning to the Church of God; and indeed, ſuch is the abominableneſs and miſchief of the danger I would give warning of, that a kinde of neceſſity is laid upon me, ſo that I muſt ſpeak.</p>
            <p>Thus <hi>Olevian</hi> (as before, <hi>Hiſt. Pſ.</hi> 53. § 115.) When I behold the ſad face of the Reformed Churches in <hi>Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,</hi> plainly, I am all over ſet in a trembling; I perceive Secular Powers have been the <hi>Accommodations</hi> of the Church; but now in many places they are turned into <hi>Dominations,</hi> and they Lord it ſecurely at their pleaſure over the Churches, and ſo over the heavenly Doctrine, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> What this means, <hi>John Valentine</hi> of <hi>Andreas,</hi> a choice Divine of the Lutherans (in his Auguration Sermon or Speech at <hi>Tubinga</hi> in the year 1642.) tells us in theſe words; The impotent Uſurped Power of the Pope over

            <p>Whence it comes to paſs, that in thoſe Churches (where <hi>Imperial Papacy</hi> rules) one of the Keys of the Kingdom of Heaven is neglected, deſpiſed, loſt. I did not know it, the <hi>Omniſcient</hi> is my witneſs, and to this very day (for what hath an incurious man to do in another man's charge) for ought I know, I might have been ignorant of it, but that ſome 14 yeers ago, by chance I came to the knowledge of it: Excuſe me as to the name (of place and perſon) and I'le relate it to you in few words. It hapned that in the chief City of <hi>Germany,</hi> I had ſome ſpeech with the chief Paſtor of the Church in that place; He told me, he
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:44083:81"/> had a good while longed for an occaſion to know, whether a Book which he had read, <hi>(viz. The way of the Diſcipline and Order of the Churches of the Brethren in Bohemia)</hi> did contain the true ſtory of that Church, or only a Model, how a Church ſhould be conſtituted? I asked, why he doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it. He anſwered, becauſe I cannot imagine any ſuch, Church <hi>ſhould,</hi> or can at this day be found in the world. I anſwered, 'twas an Hiſtory, not a Fiction there related, and that indeed there was really ſuch Orders and Conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, though they were not enough obſerved: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore now we that would not be governed thereby, are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the chaſtiſements of the Diſcipline of heaven. Saith he, O happy you, that had both the Keys, we have loſt one of them, that is, the binding Key. We are appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be ſuch Stewards in the Houſe of God, as are bound (as it were) to ſet open the Barns, Cellars, Cheſts, and all Treaſuries, and not at all to ſhut them; ſo that we cannot but give holy things to dogs, and caſt pearls before ſwine. I have known (ſaith he) ſome perſons in my Congregation, very prophane, covetous, extortioners, drunkards, adulterers, admitted to Confeſſion, and the Supper, <hi>which muſt be</hi> by me abſolved to day, and for certain would be found to morrow returning to wallow in the mire: I told him, they were not to be admitted un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs they would engage to reform. He anſwered, I tryed that, but could not carry it on, they defame me as ſome new Papiſt, or Calviniſt, my life is bitter to me, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and ſo began to ſigh and weep.</p>
            <p>I tell you a true ſtory before God, who is a moſt faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful witneſs; if haply even by this, the enormity and dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly miſchief, as well of the <hi>Imperial-Papacy,</hi> as the <hi>Papal-Empire</hi> may be made manifeſt; for by the one, as much as by the other, is the Order of the Church ſhaken, even in the very foundation, fin and judgment being filled up to the meaſure by ſuch breach of Order. Is there not ſome likeneſs between the Papal Empire of the <hi>Evangelici,</hi> and
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:44083:81"/> that <hi>Micah</hi> of Mount <hi>Ephraim,</hi> making himſelf a new God for his Houſe, and having a Prieſt to perform the Service as ſhould be by him preſcribed? (<hi>Judg.</hi> 17.) Doth it not reſemble the Policy of <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> ſetting up Calves to be his Gods, and Calviſh Prieſts to be Miniſters, becauſe (forſooth) the reaſon of State ſo required? Mark, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you, the Founders of the old and new Church, and the many Reformers, and Transformers, their divers (and even contrary) wayes! God will not be mocked; that which any man ſowes, that he ſhall alſo reap. <hi>Aaron</hi> the Prieſt, with <hi>Miriam</hi> the Propheteſs, go about to ſhake off the Authority of <hi>Moſes</hi> their Prince, and they are pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed by God with Leproſie, (<hi>Numb.</hi> 17.10, 11.) King <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>zziah</hi> again on the other ſide, caſting off the Authority of the Prieſts, uſurps their office, and he is alſo puniſhed <hi>by the ſame hand</hi> with Leproſie, (2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 26 16.) Now then, whilſt among Chriſtians both theſe offences are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, ſhall we wonder, if thoſe of both the extreams be <hi>avenged</hi> with a ſpiritual Leproſie, and other plagues? Would to God the Roman <hi>Aaron</hi> with his <hi>Miriam</hi> (his Regulars) would confeſs their errour, and render to <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar</hi> the things that are <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s, contenting himſelf with that which is allotted to him, the ſpiritual charge and care of Chriſt's Flock, (<hi>John</hi> 21.15.) But behold in <hi>Aaron</hi> and <hi>Miriam</hi> ſome hopes of <hi>pardon (Numb.</hi> 12.15.) which comfort we finde not for the Imperial-Papacy; for it is written, <hi>The Leproſie cleaved unto <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>zziah the King, unto the day of his death,</hi> (2 Chron. 26.16.) I would there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they would make haſte to get them out of the Church, (<hi>v.</hi> 15.) <hi>i. e.</hi> to reſtore the power of the Keys of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Heaven, which is given to the Church from above, but by the corruption of men, and the policy of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, now taken away from it: Verily, 'tis high time to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, and repair the impaired Order of the Church.</p>
            <p n="3">3. I paſs on to <hi>Diſcipline,</hi> as the Mean, Ligament, and Bond ordained from heaven to keep the Church in Unity
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:44083:82"/> and Order. Chriſt calls it <hi>Salt, (Mark</hi> 9.50.) becauſe as ſalt reſiſts putrefaction, and makes food ſavoury and wholſome; ſo the Diſcipline of manners heals corrupt manners, and makes us careful to keep our ſelves within the bounds of our duty, and therein to work out our own ſalvation with fear and trembling. It was not without cauſe that our Lord ſaid, Every man ſhall be ſeaſoned with ſalt, and every ſacrifice ſhall be ſalted with ſalt; <hi>v.</hi> 49. and it muſt of neceſſity be underſtood of the Diſcipline to be extended to every man which offers himſelf up a ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice unto God: For the command of God is ſtrict, (<hi>Lev.</hi> 2.13.) <hi>Whatſoever thou offereſt to the Lord, thou ſhalt ſeaſon with ſalt: Thou ſhalt not with-hold the ſalt of the Covenant of thy God from thy gift: in every offering thou ſhalt offer ſalt.</hi> I would thoſe Imperial Papiſts which would have their Churches to be without all Diſcipline, and their ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices (themſelves) without all ſalt, would ſeriouſly conſider, how in deſpight of God, exempting themſelves from all Diſcipline, they affect a moſt dangerous licenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of ſpirit.</p>
            <p>But who ſhall adminiſter this Diſcipline? Who ſhall apply this Salt to the Sacrifices of God, (to ſanctifie all ſouls to God?) Chriſt makes the anſwer to his Apoſtles, <hi>You are the ſalt of the earth,</hi> Matth. 5.13. They are then to be the Paſtors of the Church, the Succeſſors to the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles in their Office; They therefore that wreſt out of their hands the Church Diſcipline, would have them to be ſalt without all ſavour: What is it to deceive a man's ſelf, if this be not it? To have <hi>food</hi> ſweet rather then whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome. After Chriſt had ſaid, <hi>Ye are the ſalt of the earth,</hi> he addes immediately, <hi>but if ſalt</hi> ſhall be as if were not (rendred inſipid, or <hi>loſe its ſavour,) wherewith ſhall it be ſeaſoned? it is henceforth good for nothing, but to be caſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, to be trodden under foot.</hi> Conſider I pray, which of you would have your Salt (your Apoſtles) to be without ſalt; ſuch as yet you do (what in you lies) to make them
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:44083:82"/> to be in the ſight of God. O how deſerving theſe things be of our utmoſt conſideration!</p>
            <p>But granting the neceſſity of Diſcipline in the Church; of what kinde would we have it? I anſwer, Such as Chriſt inſtituted, and the Apoſtles obſerved: Watchful, ſtrict, and ſevere, wholly ſpiritual, and for edification. <hi>Watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,</hi> to be extended to all that are exorbitant, though yet according to the degree of the offence, (<hi>Mat.</hi> 18.15.) <hi>Severe,</hi> to be exerciſed without reſpect of perſons, even them that are deareſt to us, or them which are the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal members of the Church, and ſeem to be moſt neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary: Concerning which, very remarkable is the Order which Chriſt gives, that no man is to be ſpared, which gives a juſt cauſe of offence: If any ſhall be to thee as thy <hi>right</hi> hand (ſaith he to the Church) directing, and govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all thy actions, (<hi>viz.</hi> the Presbyter himſelf, or Biſhop, or Pope) or as thy foot, bearing thee up, (as the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, and thoſe in Power,) or as thy Eye, giving thee light, (as all the ſublime Doctors whoſoever) cut off both thoſe, and pull out this (ſaith he) for it is better for thee, maimed, lame, and with one eye to be preſerved unto life, then to periſh with all thy members full and entire, (<hi>v.</hi> 8, 9.) It is better then, that by the vigour, and ſtrictneſs of Diſcipline, the Church preſerve it ſelf from ſcandals, ſhould be ſmall, obſcure, and lame; than tolerating ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals and enormities, to advance her ſelf to never ſo much largeneſs, wealth, honour, and gliſtering pomp in the world. Finally, the Diſcipline of the Church ought to be proportioned to the Kingdom of Chriſt, which is altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſpiritual, and therefore <hi>revilings,</hi> baniſhments, pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niary mulcts, priſons, ſtocks, gibbets, or capital puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, (which are the kindes of Civil puniſhment) are not the weapons of our warfare: but admonitions, ſhame, terrour, and laſt of all, delivering up to the Divine judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and to Satan the Executioner thereof. Yet all theſe things not without an holy deſigne, <hi>viz.</hi> That others in the
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:44083:83"/> Church may fear, (1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.20.) and they themſelves which offend, may be ſnatched with fear out of the flames, (of ſin and death,) <hi>Jude</hi> v. 23.</p>
            <p>It remains only, that and how, the body of the Church (being well united, well ordered, and well knit together with the bands of reverence) muſt over and above this, be all filled with the Spirit of Chriſt. This is yet a further matter, and differing from the former: For any Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phical Colledge, or Secular Commonwealth, (the Lace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demonian, or ſome other, yea, and Ants and Bees too,) and the Synagogue of the Phariſees, may be a company well united, and well ordered and knit together, and yet not be the body of Chriſt, the Church, being deſtitute of his Spirit: <hi>For if any have not the Spirit of Chriſt, he is none of his;</hi> (Rom. 8.9.) What then is the Spirit of Chriſt? Even the Spirit of the life of God, quickning them that are dead in <hi>Adam,</hi> (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.45.) <hi>i. e.</hi> turning to God them which are turned from God, and them which are tranſgreſſors of the Law, to be obedient to the Law; and they that are fierce, to be milde, humble, patient; in a word, making men new brought off from Satan, the world, and the fleſh, and offering themſelves up to God alone, to do, and ſuffer all his Will. This verily is the meaning of that which Chriſt ſpeaketh, <hi>If any man will come after me, he muſt deny himſelf, and take up his Croſs, and follow me,</hi> (Matth. 16.24.) and whoever cannot or will not do ſo, he denies, that he can be his Diſciple, <hi>Luke</hi> 14.26.32.</p>
            <p>Becauſe thoſe myſteries of Chriſtianity are commonly not at all, or negligently taught; thence it is that moſt Chriſtians know not what 'tis to be Chriſtians, much leſs are ſuch indeed. <hi>Adam</hi> ſways all, Chriſt <hi>very</hi> few; becauſe very few endeavour to put off the old man, and to put on the new, (which is created after God) and to be transform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into him, and made one Spirit with him, (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.17.) and ſo to become by regeneration the Sons of God, and to ceaſe from ſin, as he doth: When as notwithſtanding, the
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:44083:83"/> grace of God which bringeth ſalvation in Chriſt, hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to all men, that denying ungodlineſs and worldly luſts, we may live ſoberly, righteouſly, and godly in this preſent world; looking for that bleſſed hope of glory at the appearance of Jeſus Chriſt, who hath given himſelf for us to redeem us from all iniquity, and to purifie us to himſelf, a peculiar people, zealouſly ſtudious of good works, (<hi>Tit.</hi> 2.) Therefore it is to be earneſtly deſired and endeavoured, that Chriſtians would at laſt begin ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly to be a people renouncing the world, reſigned to God, having their commoration indeed <hi>for a while</hi> on earth, but their converſation in heaven, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.10.</p>
            <p>Thus as touching the ſalvation of the Church, I have let you underſtand (from § 30. hitherto,) my deſires, yea the deſires of Chriſt, and all the Saints in heaven and earth; and now, becauſe there is no effect without its cauſe, and what God ordinarily doth, he doth by ordinary means, <hi>Men;</hi> I demand now, if we ſaw God at this day looking about for a man which ſhould ſtop the gap, and ſtand up in the breach, he were like to finde any ſuch? and whether, if he found none, he would not pour down the fiery ſtorm of his wrath? (as of old he did, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 22.30, 31.) Or if we heard him ſay, Whom ſhall I ſend? Who will go for us? whether or no there will be found an <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> which may ſay, Behold here am I, ſend me? (<hi>Jſa.</hi> 6.8.) God have mercy, and ſend ſome, not <hi>Jſaiah</hi>'s only, which ſhould in ſpeaking be nothing elſe but for a witneſs, to further hardneſs of heart, and ruine, (<hi>ib. v.</hi> 9. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) but alſo <hi>Elias</hi>'s, which may turn the heart of the Fathers to the children, <hi>&amp;c. (Matth.</hi> 4.4.) O ſtir up alſo <hi>David</hi>'s, and <hi>Solomon</hi>'s, <hi>Jehoſaphat</hi>'s, and <hi>Joſias</hi>'s, <hi>Zerubbabel</hi>'s, and <hi>Conſtantine</hi>'s, &amp;c. to be glorious repairers of the collapſed ruinous condition of the Church!</p>
            <p>And whereſoever in all the world God ſhall vouchſafe to raiſe up ſuch, they will alſo in like manner daigne God this honour, as to do nothing, but according to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcript
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:44083:84"/> 
               <hi>of his Will:</hi> becauſe this is no work of man to be done after the wiſdom of man, but his, who ſaid to <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, Look to it, and do according to the pattern which I have ſhewed unto thee,</hi> Exod. 25. <hi>v.</hi> 40. and to <hi>Joſhua, Turn not aſide, to the right hand, or to the left,</hi> Joſh. 1.7. That therefore they may be aſſured, and the faithful people with them, that 'tis the Lord, which repaireth his own houſe; they muſt take that of the Lord for an everlaſting rule, <hi>It was not thus in the beginning,</hi> Matth. 19.8. <hi>i. e.</hi> Have a care, that, that which is not of Divine Inſtitution, but contrary thereunto, be taken away, (<hi>Matth.</hi> 15.13.) and what ever is inſtituted by God, but through careleſneſs of man neglected, or hath by guile been changed, be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored, (<hi>Matth.</hi> 5.17. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) Let things indifferent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main indifferent; <hi>i. e.</hi> things which only cuſtome hath brought in, if they be not prejudicial to piety, be patiently born, and not without urgent neceſſity taken away.</p>
            <p>Another thing to be piouſly obſerved, is, That nothing be done by Tumult and Violence (againſt the conſent of the Church, or any part thereof) but by the common coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel and conſent, leſt there be given occaſion of new breach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es: Wiſe is that counſel of wiſe <hi>Elihu; Let us chuſe us out judgement, and ſee among our ſelves what is beſt,</hi> Job 34.4. Out of which place it is plain, 1. That it cannot be otherwiſe, but that men ſomtimes will be of different apprehenſions. 2. 'Tis not alwayes neceſſary that they muſt be divided, there being given to men a liberty of choice, as to the debating and determining of their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs. 3. That that determination may and ought to be done patiently, or peaceably, and with a rational delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The beſt way then is, when any controverſie ariſes, (as there are too many ariſen among us) that the parties be called together, and patiently heard, and reaſon compared with reaſon, Scripture with Scripture, until coming to the bottome of the thing, there remains nothing to any, which he can juſtly deſire, or rationally contradict.</p>
            <pb n="37" facs="tcp:44083:84"/>
            <p>I was upon it before (§. 35.) to wiſh, that ſome grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and more famous Church would try to undertake the buſineſs, (<hi>viz.</hi> of a more full, and holy Reformation, then can hitherto be found) and I cannot give it over in as much as a beginning muſt ſome where, and by ſome be made, if we expect a Change of Chriſtianity for the better. Now becauſe there is no Church to be ſeen under the whole Heaven, which hath more eyes upon it, and which is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſupplyed with meanes conducing to ſo great an affaire; nor where there doth ſway a more adventuring zeale to ſeek out the things which are beſt; nor yet to whom God hath given ſuch excellent opportunities, as are found in the Church of <hi>England.</hi> I addreſſe therefore again to thee thou Spouſe of Chriſt, and ſhall pray for happy ſucceſſe to attend thy proceedings.</p>
            <p>Verily, O thou Engliſh Church, thou art indeed in this our Age a City ſet upon an Hill, which cannot be hid, (<hi>Mat.</hi> 5.14.) where Chriſt the light of the World darts his brighteſt beames, and wherein ſo many lightened Candles (Books of profound ſpirituall wiſdome) have been held forth in their Candleſticks: That of your light ſo many Chriſtian Nations borrow their light, reading your books, and ſtriving frequently to tranſlate them into their own Tongues; that what the Apoſtle in his time ſaid of his <hi>Theſſalonians,</hi> may be ſaid of you; <hi>The Goſpel of God is amongſt you, not in word only, but in power, and in the holy Ghost, even in much abundance; and you are become the patterns to all that believe:</hi> 1 Theſſ. 1.5, 7. Which grace we muſt not envie in you, but pray for your increaſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, and imitate the zeal of your piety.</p>
            <p>I ſaid that you were ſupplyed with means of a further Reformation before others; becauſe you having framed among you now for the ſpace of an whole age, Meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of all the Myſteries of the Kingdom of God, and printed Books of all ſuch kinde of ſubjects; you ſeem to have done as <hi>Solomon</hi> did the firſt ſix years, when he
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:44083:85"/> was to build his glorious Temple unto God; ſeeking to get ſtuff in a readineſs, felling Wood in <hi>Libanus,</hi> ſqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Stones, caſting Veſſels, and carrying together Gold, and precious Stones, for the glory of the Houſe of God: As therefore the ſetting up of this at laſt, when he had fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted all and every of the particulars, was no hard matter for <hi>Solomon;</hi> ſo neither will it be for you, eſpecially now, that you have ſuch plenty of workmen, every one moſt ingenious, conferring his Talent of activity hereunto.</p>
            <p>For as it was there, there being ſo many thouſand cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful workmen, and among them, ſo many of the moſt skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Artificers, which (under the eyes and direction of wiſe <hi>Solomon</hi>) ſtriving in diligence to out-doe each other, quickly diſpatched and finiſhed all; ſo it is plain to ſee this holy emulation working alſo in yours, even all along through this Century (notwithſtanding the diviſions always continued among you, about the Form of Church-Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) in which time, there have been made up, as well by a conſiderable number of Reverend Biſhops, (<hi>Jewell, Andrews, Hall, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſher,</hi> &amp;c.) as by other learned and godly men, of them which appeared, and approved them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be the better part, and more reformed from the ſuperſtitions; ſo many exact pieces, that I think we may-affirm, that the heavenly <hi>Solomon</hi> permitted, and throughout during the whole Century, tolerated thoſe <hi>diſſentions amongſt his Workmen,</hi> to this very end, that by their mutual emulation, all things might be done on all hands with ſo much acuteneſs: Behold what remains, but that the like activity be <hi>uſed</hi> on all hands, as zealouſly to make up, and finiſh entire thoſe things which have been hitherto wrought up by parts and parcels.</p>
            <p>Hereunto alſo thoſe opportunities, ſuch as you have not had in all this generation before, ſuch as no Chriſtian Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ever hitherto enjoyed, may induce you: For your late tempeſtuous State of affairs among you, being now calmed, your Halcyon dayes returned, the Renowned Head of
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:44083:85"/> your Commonwealth reſtored; the Fathers of your Country conſpiring in common for the common ſafety; the people alſo falling in with their earneſt prayers to help you; and your neighbours on every ſide bleſſing you with good ſpeed; <hi>do you not believe</hi> that the heavenly Husband ſpeaks to his Spouſe among you, as <hi>Cant.</hi> 2.11. <hi>The win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is past, the rain is over, and gone, the flowers appear on the earth, the time of ſinging of Birds is come, the voice of the Turtle is heard in our land,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Ariſe my Love, my Fair one, and come away.</hi> In truth, the times you now ſee, <hi>ſeem to be the very times of Solomon,</hi> wherein 'tis not all, that you may every one ſit under his Vine and his Fig-tree, but the Houſe of God alſo is to be built, all things neceſſary and requiſite being now made ready; on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ceaſe not to pray, That God would pleaſe to fill your <hi>Solomon</hi> full of the Spirit of Wiſdom and Zeal.</p>
            <p>And God grant you may put together, and ſet up your hitherto prepared pieces, after the example of <hi>Solomon</hi>'s workmen, <hi>without the noiſe of Hammers and Axes,</hi> (1 King. 6.7.) <hi>i. e.</hi> without any quarrelling, or violence, or mutual circumventing one another by fraud, peaceably, candidly, ſucceſsfully. Beſides, the Wiſdom of <hi>Solomon</hi> mindes you of this alſo in reference to your building now <hi>in hand;</hi> The foundations and the Walls muſt be <hi>only</hi> of the moſt ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid ſtuff, Marble, (<hi>v.</hi> 7.) The Cieling and Roof to cover all, muſt be of Cedar, (9. <hi>&amp;</hi> 15.) and all to be at laſt covered over with Gold, (22.) <hi>i. e.</hi> what ever you frame, (from the foundation even to the top) you muſt be ſure, if it be poſſible, that it be as Adamantine, cut out of the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to be ſhaken Rock of the Word of God; or if any thing be added of humane reaſon, let it not be otherwiſe then as of Cedar, ſtreight, plain, of good ſavour and repute, <hi>incorruptible,</hi> taken out of common received Principles; and then let all be covered with the gold of pure charity, that all may approve themſelves as evidently directed to the mark of common edification.</p>
            <pb n="40" facs="tcp:44083:86"/>
            <p>And that the Scripture repreſents <hi>Solomon</hi> as ſtudious of Gold and precious Stones, 1 <hi>Kings.</hi> 10.10, 11. Even from this alſo it may be uſeful to obſerve, that whatſoever it pleaſes God that we finde rare and precious in ſpiritual good things and gifts, that we ſhould be deſirous to make our own. This our heavenly <hi>Solomon</hi> himſelf, in that Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable in <hi>Matth.</hi> 13. <hi>v.</hi> 45, 46. hath taught us; <hi>The King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Heaven is like unto a Merchant ſeeking goodly pearls, and when be had found one pearl of great price, he went and ſold all he had, and bought it.</hi> Such Merchants were my Predeceſſors before the two laſt ages, gathering all what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever was precious out of the mines of the holy Scriptures, out of all Antiquity, and out of all the Churches in their time, as 'tis plain in ſtory. Such alſo were thoſe men of Deſire of the laſt Century before ours, (<hi>Bucer, Zanchy, Vergerius,</hi> &amp;c.) which in like manner trying all things, have teſtified, that they found ſome ſingular precious pearls even among <hi>Ours:</hi> And ſuch Jewellers have you hitherto been, by the grace of God, lading in together treaſures of moſt precious Jewels, wherein you triumph, and many rejoyce with you. But in as much as our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our ſaith, <hi>To him which hath, it ſhall be given;</hi> aſſure your ſelves, that you having ſo much, ſhall have yet more added thereto, if you go on to be diligent and inquiſitive Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants.</p>
            <p>The moſt precious Jewel of all, more worth then hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and earth, is but one, Jeſus Chriſt the Saviour of the world: and there are alſo other particular Pearls, the manifold graces of Chriſt; the ſum of which perhaps God would have repreſented by <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rim</hi> and <hi>Thummim,</hi> which properly what they were, the Jews, and we with them, to this day know not, they being loſt in the firſt Temple. But not being to ſeek after the underſtanding of the words, we think we underſtand what God means in the now Church thereby; <hi>viz.</hi> Light, and Integrity, or Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection; of this Chriſt ſpeaks, <hi>Let your light ſo ſhine,</hi> &amp;c.
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:44083:86"/> alſo, <hi>Be perfect, as your Father which is in heaven is perfect</hi> Matth. 5.16. &amp; 48.</p>
            <p>And verily, by the grace of God, you my well-beloved, have found the reſplendent <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rim,</hi> ſo that the Churches of ſo many Nations ſee your light, and rejoyce in it. Our Predeceſſors indeed, we muſt confeſs, were never honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with ſo much light, being more ſolicitous about the <hi>Thummim;</hi> to wit, how they might walk before God (as <hi>Abraham</hi>) uprightly, with what degree of perfection of ſincerity <hi>may</hi> in this life be attained to. Other holy Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants have witneſſed as much, <hi>viz.</hi> That they found the <hi>Thummim (i. e.</hi> the rule leading men toward perfection in Chriſt) among them in greater perfection, then could be found any where elſe in their generation: Why ſhould we deſpiſe their counſel, and not to ſeek &amp; ſcrape even a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them alſo, to finde either ſome gem, or ſome grain? Let us do our beſt, holy Brethren, to have the light of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, and the Canon and Rule of our direction in perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, that ſo the Churches may have you, and yours for an example: This will make much for the glory of God, and for your honour too, in the day of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>I commend to you in particular, a glittering pearl of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Olevian,</hi> out of the premiſed <hi>Hiſt.</hi> 115. The late ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream corruption of this generation (ſaith he) moveth me, and my Colleagues not a little, to have ſome confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence with you about the beſt way of Governing the Church; for we would ſo build, that our Fabrick may ſtand firm unto poſterity: We ſee what great differences, and how ſudden changes are made in thoſe Churches, which their Right and Priviledges being taken away, are wholly at the devotion of the Civil Polities: Unleſs proviſion be timely made for the ſtopping of theſe evils, many of the godly, even the greateſt part, will conclude they have run in vain; and ſo on there, many golden ſentences fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, moſt deſerving, not only reading, but our ſerious conſiderations.</p>
            <pb n="42" facs="tcp:44083:87"/>
            <p>And here even you alſo may take notice of ſome excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent pearls worth your obſervation; 1. That in the deſign which you alſo now drive, whether of Reformation, or Confirmation, you ſhould be fixed and reſolved, that what you do, may be firm and durable for the generation to come.</p>
            <p n="2">2. To tremble at that word; what differences, what ſudden changes are made, where the Churches are depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of their Right and Power.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That unleſs ſome timely courſe be taken to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand theſe evils, (as indeed we did not timely obviate them in <hi>Germany,</hi>) the godly will <hi>think,</hi> &amp;c. Ah! they do think, and feel it, and <hi>Luther</hi> while he was yet living felt it, that they that were under the grace of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, were become worſe, then they that were under the rigour of the Papacy; as if the unclean ſpirit were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned with ſeven ſpirits worſe then himſelf, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And how could it be otherwiſe, no bounds of Order and Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline being ſet for preſervation? and the keyes of Chriſt being more perniciouſly curtailed, then the Euchariſt in the Papacy.</p>
            <p n="4">4. As to which matter, we <hi>ingeniouſly</hi> acknowledge what God hath conferred upon you, and deſire ſtill more fully to acknowledge it, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and that in things of ſuch concern, counſels are by no means to be precipitated, but exquiſitely laid together; and God from heaven is to be called upon for counſel, with greater vehemency then in any other thing that can be named.</p>
            <p>As for that queſtion which is chiefly controverted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt you, concerning the beſt way and Form of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Church, I will ſay no more, having in the Tractate of <hi>Independency,</hi> ſaid what ever I thought could be ſaid in this caſe for accommodation and peace: Only thus much, That that golden rule of Chriſt, of a Reformation in Life firſt, rather than in faith, and outward Ceremonies, (<hi>John</hi>
               <pb n="43" facs="tcp:44083:87"/> 7. <hi>v.</hi> 17.) is of <hi>golden</hi> uſe in this buſineſs; for that man, who-ever he be, which ſeeks not himſelf and his own Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, but Chriſt only, and in him ſalvation, his own, and another's, will more eaſily diſcern what tends more or leſs hereunto, being taught by that anointing within himſelf, which he hath from the holy Ghoſt, 1 <hi>John</hi> 7.20, 27.</p>
            <p>But yet I query, <hi>Whether or no,</hi> if a Civil Society be well, and rightful, preſerved in one place by <hi>Monarchical Government,</hi> (where the people commit their ſafety to ſome one perſon as the ableſt and the wiſeſt.) In another place by <hi>Ariſtocratical Government,</hi> (where the care is committed to ſome few of their own, as able and wiſe.) In another by <hi>Democratical Government,</hi> (where the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple govern themſelves by turns.) <hi>Religious</hi> Society may not be in like manner ſo provided for, <hi>i. e.</hi> whether Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copal Government may not as well be endured, where it hath long been, as Conſiſtorial where that obtains; and Presbyterial or Claſſical, where that is in uſe: It ſeems probable it may be ſo, for as much as every one of theſe Governments hath ſome good in it, conducing unto the publick good, ſo it be guarded from abuſe, <hi>v.g.</hi> The goodneſs of Monarchy is an uniting vertue, preventing the ruine that may quickly ariſe <hi>from differences,</hi> by reaſon of the multitude of counſels: The goodneſs of <hi>Democracy</hi> is a diffuſive vertue, ſuffering no member to be eaſily over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlipt in the <hi>diſpenſation</hi> of the common Cauſe or Intereſt: The goodneſs of <hi>Ariſtocracy</hi> is a collective vertue, knit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting together Superiours with Inferiours, and Inferiours with Superiours; and cauſing many <hi>Members</hi> to keep themſelves under one, and one to <hi>diffuſe</hi> himſelf unto ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny.. Hence ſome Nations have pleaſed themſelves with one, others with this, or that; and ſo it is at this day: and they all keep up themſelves in their ſeveral Forms of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, the one, and the other; which is an argument, that there is in each one of them a proper and peculiar
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:44083:88"/> vertue, to contain humane Society within its due bounds, by the bonds thereof: Only indeed, through abuſe admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, <hi>Monarchy</hi> eaſily degenerated into Tyranny, <hi>Ariſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cracy</hi> into Oligarchy, and <hi>Democracy</hi> into Anarchy, which is worſe than any Tyranny.</p>
            <p>But againe, of all theſe 3 kinds of Government may there not be a contemperation or temperature? which may make for the improving of that which is good in each of them, and correcting of that which is evill. It may ſeem poſſible by the Rule of Chriſt: <hi>This doe, and leave not the other:</hi> And that of the Apoſtle, <hi>Try all things and hold faſt that which is good.</hi> Viz: by holding in each of theſe Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments that which is excellent, that of a threefold good may be made one very good. <hi>v. g.</hi> of Monarchy and Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copacy, the uniting good of Ariſtocracy, and Church-S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nat, the Collective vertue, of Democracy, and Presbitery, the diffuſive good. Of ſuch a kind of temper, was the Common-wealth of the <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> having one King, but to whom they put their <hi>Ephori,</hi> as the Overſeers of Actions, and the power of chuſing reſiding in the Common-people: So in the Roman Empire, which was of great ſtrength, the power and ſtrength was in the peoples hands, the counſel in the Senate, and the executive part, or exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, belonged to the two Conſuls: The like prudent temperation is at this day to be ſeen in the Venetian Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth, and in ſome Kingdoms, eſpecially that of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Polonia:</hi> There is a King for Majeſty, yet therewithal a Senate conſiſting of the Optimates, or the Nobles, and there is alſo the very Commonwealth it ſelf by the Commons, their Legates, or Repreſenters, ſuffering nothing to be enacted touching themſelves, without them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: And this courſe ſeems to excel all others for ſtabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, having remedies alwayes in readineſs in reference to all grievances whatſoever. Now whether or no we may not ſee ſuch a temperature alſo in the Eccleſiaſtical State
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:44083:88"/> under the Apoſtles? when as there were for the manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of buſineſſes, and deciding of controverſies, 1. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, 2. Seniors, 3. The Church. <hi>Acts</hi> 15.22. And whether or no it be any where more evident in our Age, then in the Churches of the <hi>Bohemian</hi> Fraternal Unity, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Biſhops, Conſiſtories, Synods? I leave it to the Churches to judge.</p>
            <p>It is queried further, Whether or no thoſe inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and hazards which have been found in this, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and the third Government, and the abuſes and ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals of each of them hereupon, <hi>may</hi> be <hi>taken away.</hi> I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, Phyſitians will not think that there be any diſeaſes of the body incurable, if there be a skilful Phyſitian at hand, timely to relieve <hi>Nature;</hi> therefore neither let Chriſtians deſpair as to the <hi>diſeaſes</hi> of the Church, provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded only that the counſel of the heavenly Arch-Phyſitian be hearkned to and taken; they adviſe to care and cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that the diſeaſe <hi>get not a head</hi> by long continuance, crying, withſtand the Beginnings; but our High-all-Healer is able to cure even the moſt inveterate, by reducing things to their beginnings (<hi>Matth.</hi> 19.8.) by vertue of which Rule, Let that be taken away from Epiſcopacy, which was not in the beginning, and <hi>the Diſeaſe is cured.</hi> But what is that? 1. <hi>Secular Domination.</hi> 2. <hi>Earthly Riches.</hi> 3. <hi>Pomp of Ceremonies;</hi> for Chriſt hath ſaid, 1. <hi>Kings exerciſe Lordſhip,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>But you ſhall not be ſo,</hi> Luk. 22.25. 2. Poſſeſs not you gold, nor ſilver, nor money in your purſes, nor have you two coats, <hi>Matth.</hi> 19.9. As alſo God forbad earthly Poſſeſſions ſhould be <hi>aſſigned</hi> to the Prieſts in the old Teſtament; giving the reaſon alſo, <hi>I will be their portion and inheritance,</hi> Numb. 18.20. Deut. 10.9. &amp; 18.2. 3. Chriſt alſo taught them to ſerve God in Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and Truth, not in Ceremonies, <hi>John</hi> 4.23. which thing the Apoſtles very much preſſed.</p>
            <p>But they aſſert themſelves (in reſpect of their Wealth
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:44083:89"/> and Domination) by the Donation of <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> He a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorned the Church with ſuch ſplendour, for the honour of Chriſt, and therein ſet a <hi>good</hi> example of holy zeal for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Chriſtian Kings <hi>to follow.</hi> But the anſwer hereunto is manifold, 1. Do they not know, can they not tell the ſtory of a voice which as at this time was heard, <hi>This day is poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon poured out into the Church?</hi> What-ever any may make of the voice, the thing is certain; That thoſe endowments (being given and accepted beſide the Will of God) turned unto poyſon; Let the poyſon then be taken out, and the Church will be well again. 2. Again, Grant it were <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantine</hi>'s pious zeal, yet 'tis evident, that it was not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to knowledge; for it was not lawful for him to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe with the Interdict of God, much leſs ought the <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants</hi> of Chriſt to admit ſuch things againſt their Lord's Will. <hi>Naaman</hi> the Syrian in pious zeal offered <hi>Elizeus</hi> money, but with better zeal he refuſed this Lumber, <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hezi</hi> took it, but it turned unto Leproſie upon him, 2 <hi>Kin.</hi> 5. I would the ſervants (not of <hi>Elizeus</hi>) but of Chriſt, would at this time but underſtand, what a fooliſh choice they have made, of an earthly inſtead of an heavenly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance; and would begin to think of ſome courſe to <hi>cleanſe the Church of this Leproſie.</hi> 3. I anſwer, <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine</hi> could not foreſee the abuſe of this Donation, and the miſchief that thereby would fall upon the Church: Now the whole world ſees it, and if he were riſen again, and ſhould ſee it, undoubtedly his deſire to reſtore the Church to her integrity, would put him upon it, to retract what he gave, with a better good will then ever he gave it: As haply <hi>Moſes</hi> himſelf would have broken the Brazen Serpent, if he had ſeen how it would be abuſed, (as when he ſaw the Idolatry of the people, he brake the two Tables of the Law, written with God's own hand,) and in as much as <hi>Hezekiah</hi> coming after him, did it piouſly as it were for him, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 18.4. why may not godly Kings at this day
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:44083:89"/> piouſly alſo retract the liberal donations of their pious Anceſtors, now perverted by abominable abuſes, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove them to better purpoſes?</p>
            <p>As for the pomp of Church Ceremonies, God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed in the old way of Worſhip ordained ſuch a thing, therein by ſhaddows to ſet forth the ſpiritual myſteries of ſalvation (which Chriſt at his coming was to diſcloſe) but ſeeing, that ſince the coming of Chriſt they have been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moliſhed, and levelled by ſo many Apoſtolical ſtrains, as claps of thunder, and flaſhes of lightning directed againſt them, why ſhould we bring them up again, ſtill to make uſe of them? Under the Papacy perhaps, where the light of the Goſpel is once obſcured, by and in the barbarous generations, they may have ſeemed, or ſeem to be of ſome uſe, at leaſt with ſome colourable pretence; but in a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Church, I beſeech you, what uſe can be made of them? Thoſe which have been hitherto retained in <hi>England</hi> (under the Reformed Biſhops) have not the very Pontifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians themſelves laughed at them unto ſcorn and deriſion? It is plain to be ſeen in that <hi>Edward Weſton</hi>'s <hi>Theater of Life Civil and Sacred,</hi> (Printed at <hi>Antwerp,</hi> 1626.) p. 564. &amp;c. where (having ſaid that the Religion of the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants is without all Religion, becauſe they have no Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, Prieſthood, nor Sacred Ceremonies) he adds, Some Proteſtants indeed that they may not appear abſolutely im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious, and irreligious, uſe our Miſſal and Breviary, ſelecting what they pleaſe thereof for the Rubrick of <hi>their</hi> Liturgie; and to make the Form of their worſhip appear the more goodly, they have their <hi>Canonical perſons</hi> forſooth, and their Arch-DeaconS, and ſo, after the mode and cuſtome of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> their Caps, and Hoods, and Holidayes, and ſuch like ſtuff and lumber, which they ſay they found in the Synagogue of Antichriſt. By which very thing it is apparent, that the Religion of the Proteſtants ſtands guilty of ſtealth, and robbery, by which it firſt came into the
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:44083:90"/> world; or if they will not be taken for thieves, let them ſtill go for our Apes, and Antichriſts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and ſo he goes on; Theſe, with all their whole ſervice, are derided and ſcorned, not only by ours, but alſo by their own, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> at laſt he ſet down the judgement of one to this purpoſe: The Engliſh ſeem to have driven the Pope out of their King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom in ſuch haſte, that they compelled him to leave his clothes behinde him, which they <hi>(as fools in a play)</hi> put on, with a kinde of pompous Ceremony of triumph, and ſo lead their Quite. O how we are abuſed by their dallying and colloguing; they being Reformed, but not to any purpoſe: <hi>A goodly Reformation it is, that they dare not carry it through.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It will therefore be a glorious thing for the Reformed Churches to come back to the practiſe of Chriſt and his Apoſtles, leaving off the baubles of earthly riches, honours, and pomp, (both Eccleſiaſtical and Civil,) to be taken up, look after, and buſie themſelves about matters of an higher nature: <hi>Seek the things that are above</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>where Christ ſitteth at the right hand of God.</hi> Set your af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections upon, and let your care be for things above, not things on the earth; for <hi>you are dead, and your life is hid with Chriſt in God,</hi> Col. 3.1, 2, 3. which if it be enjoyned all Chriſtians, much more them which are ſet next under Chriſt, to be leaders unto others from earth to heaven, and to whom the King of Kings hath ſaid, <hi>All power is given to me in heaven &amp; earth, go you</hi> (<gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>) <hi>make all Nations my Diſciples,</hi> Matth. 28. <hi>i. e.</hi> advance my king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, both by outward preaching unto all Nations, and by the inward power of my Spirit, learning of me to live, not an earthly but a heavenly life; O how <hi>invaluable</hi> and <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable</hi> would this be, if you did but know how much you are (advanced) above all earthly things: but alas! the higheſt of the Biſhops at this day, ſtick in the very firſt ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diments of the Apoſtles, not aſpiring unto any degree of
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:44083:90"/> high Apoſtolical perfection! What was their firſt rudeneſs? To dream of Earthly Kingdoms, and Thrones with Chriſt, where to ſit on the right hand, and on the left. What their high perfection? To count all things here as dung, for the excellency of Chriſt, and caſting all Worldly Intereſts behinde them, to preſs forward for the prize of the High Calling, (<hi>Phil.</hi> 3.) and ſo to rejoyce in the hope of future glory, and glory in Affliction, the Croſs, Martyrdoms, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I would here lay down my Pen, but that this ſwelling excreſcence of the Church (by tract of time hath gotten ſuch an extreme hard cruſt upon it) that it ſeems needful to ply it with oft-renewed-mollify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing applications: Let it be taken therefore how it will, I offer in the ſight of the Church my deſire of things of the better ſort: Now that which God makes and ordains muſt needs be better, than that which man inſtitutes; for the works of God are perfect, (<hi>Deut.</hi> 32.4.) that which he eſtabliſhes for ever: and the decrees which he makes, no man may paſs over, (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 148.6.) behold then, whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they be among men, which God doth appoint to be guides of others unto heaven, all thoſe he ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely declares in both the Teſtaments, that he would have them altogether free from earthly cares: firſt ſtraitly forbidding his people <hi>Iſrael</hi> by <hi>Moſes,</hi> to allot to them any inheritance amongſt them; and then ſeverely charging the Prieſts themſelves, that they ſhould not admit of any ſuch terrene poſſeſſion.</p>
            <p>And Chriſt did the ſame, for thoſe which he choſe for himſelf to be Meſſengers to the Gentiles, he made leave their Nets, Cuſtoms, and all wayes what ever of getting gain; yea, and himſelf alſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about to diſcharge his Commiſſion in reference
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:44083:91"/> to mankinde, laid aſide even his heavenly Riches Honours, Thrones, (to reach that theſe at leaſt are utterly incompatible) and became poor, contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptible, and low, having not upon earth whereon to lay his head. Verily it was to be fulfilled which was typified in <hi>David;</hi> who had no hopes to triumph over <hi>Goliah,</hi> till he put off the Royal accoutrements, and addreſſed himſelf in the habit of a Shepherd; and in <hi>Gideon,</hi> who being to diſcomfite the Midia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites, was firſt to diſmiſs his numerous Armed For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, reſerving to himſelf nothing but his Lamps and Trumpets; and then, as <hi>Gideon</hi> ſaid to his compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, <hi>As I do, ſo do ye:</hi> (Judg. 7.17.) So Chriſt beſpeaks his, I have ſet you an example, that, what I do, ye may do alſo; (<hi>John</hi> 13.15.) Why do we not then imitate him, if we would perſwade our ſelves, that we are the Sub-Delegates of that Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate <hi>from heaven?</hi> He, though they made him an overture of Regal Dignity, accepted it not; (<hi>John</hi> 6.) though they would proclaim him King (<hi>Luke</hi> 19.38.) yet he perſiſted, taking to himſelf no Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle but that of Maſter (22.11.) being asked whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he was a King; He made anſwer, <hi>My Kingdom is not of this World:</hi> Being aſſured that there was reſerved for him a Royal Throne in Heaven: Why not we in like manner, having a promiſe of the ſame Throne? Howbeit, not unleſs we firſt overcome, (<hi>Apoc.</hi> 5.21.</p>
            <p>Moſt certain then it is, that Epiſcopal pre-emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence conſiſts not in this, to poſſeſs vaſt <hi>Demeſnes,</hi> to ſhine in Gold, to be ſurrounded with a Retinue, to be carryed in Coaches, or lie on Beds of Doun, to be clothed in Scarlet, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but to be deep in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Piety of the heart, and profound in Divine Knowledge, with Zeal for the Glory of God, and
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:44083:91"/> the Salvation of the Church, as alſo of improved ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience <hi>in the things of God;</hi> renouncing and abju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring our own private profit; theſe are the things which <hi>make up the Pourtraiture, or Eſſence</hi> of a true Biſhop; and his outward Characters are many; to be much in Labour, and Travel, in Watchings, in Hunger, and Thirſt, in Faſtings, and Solicitouſneſs for all the Churches; to be weak with them that are weak, and to burn when others are offended; (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.) and ſo to bear about in their bodies the marks of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, (<hi>Gal.</hi> 6.17.) and when he meets with one ſick of the (ſpiritual) Palſie, to ſay, Silver and Gold I have none, but ſuch as I have, I give thee, in the name of Jeſus Chriſt, ariſe (out of the bed of vain and ſinful ſtate) and walk in the wayes of Chriſt, (<hi>Acts</hi> 3.) In a Word, not at all to ſavour <hi>Earthly things;</hi> for he which talks of the earth, is earthly; (<hi>John</hi> 3.31.) but to ſhew in word and works, that he is the Meſſenger of the Lord from Heaven; who gives life to all, (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.45.47.)</p>
            <p>If Biſhops and all they that diſcharge any Embaſſie for Chriſt, hope to be ſuch, verily their worldly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditaments, earthly dominions, and ſecular honours, muſt be taken away; for theſe are baits, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane perſons ſwallowing, and being caught withal, croud themſelves into Eccleſiaſtical preferments, ſhut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and thruſting out their betters: For it is vain that <hi>Bellarmine</hi> ſaith, The Sea of <hi>Rome</hi> either admits them which are Saints, or makes them ſuch. It is more truly retorted by another, that it either embraceth them that are wicked, or makes them ſuch. For men cannot reach to ſuch an height, but they muſt be very worldly, ambitious, ſubtle to deceive by a thouſand tricks more than are good: Yea, if it be ſo, that haply
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:44083:92"/> ſome of the better ſort fly ſo high, yet it is almoſt impoſſible but they will be taken wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>h (a ſpirit of) giddineſs, by reaſon of the very heighth of their condition: And the ſame muſt be ſaid of every Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops Sea ſet out with ſuch pomp and riches, that theſe things either are poſſeſſed by ſuch as are ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, covetous, idle drones, and effeminate, or elſe they ſoon make them ſuch. Theſe ſweet poyſons, (the pomps of Riches and Honours) can hardly be drunk deeply off by any one, and he remain innocent.</p>
            <p>Let no man ſay within himſelf, the Mendicant condemns them that have riches, becauſe he hath none himſelf; for indeed, he which is out of the miſt, can the better ſee the cloud: nor yet need we to be ſo indigent, if modeſty, and fear of venomous dregs ſtood not in our way: I could tell you, the ſpirit of zeal hath ſomtime raiſed up them among us alſo, that by liberal Donation would have ſetled ſufficient large Revenues upon our Church for ever; (as in <hi>Moravia, B. B.</hi> of <hi>Z.</hi> in <hi>Bohemia, Pr.</hi> of <hi>Roſenberg,</hi>) they were only finding out a way how theſe Demeſnes might with ſome colour be made over to be poſſeſſed by ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, ſo as yet the rents might be paid to the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſtites</hi> of the Unity: But it was not accepted, both becauſe it could hardly be concealed, but and if it ſhould have been known, it would have provoked en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vie; and becauſe our Anceſtors dreaded the (not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning) footſteps, reckoning themſelves to be but men, and ſo liable alſo to abuſe this worlds goods, but moſt of all, becauſe of the Divine Inhibition and Command.</p>
            <p>God grant the Succeſſors of the Apoſtles the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of the Apoſtles, that being fully perſwaded that there is nothing urged but that which is Apoſtolical, if haply the Church ſhall think fit otherwiſe to diſpoſe
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:44083:92"/> of her <hi>Benefices,</hi> yet none dare to have a thought of raiſing tumults or wars upon that account (as they <hi>Mich.</hi> 3.5.) or caſt off their <hi>charge;</hi> But rather be ſo much the more inſtant, and cheerful in the work of their Divine Calling, in as much as any fight or work is managed with the greater eaſe, when clogs and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbrances are removed. Did not the Apoſtles of their own accord (committing the care of inferiour matters to others, <hi>Acts</hi> 6.) chuſe to be Diſpencers of the Divine Word, and not of Tables? Let then the followers of the Apoſtles do the ſame, eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, that they are Stewards of thoſe Spiritual, Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly, and Eternal Treaſures, a thouſand times more than if they had the charge of earthly riches.</p>
            <p>Nor doe theſe things tend thereunto; That the faithful Servants of Chriſt ſhould be defrauded of their Rewards, and Honours; but that they ſhould learn how to eſtimate as well their labours, as the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards thereof, better then they ſeem to <hi>know how</hi> to do it; which gaping ſo greedily after theſe outward things, are carried with a curſed negligence and indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, as to the internal and eternal matters. God indeed liberally provided for his Miniſters under the old Covenant, appointing that the whole people ſhould <hi>bring in</hi> to them all the Firſt Fruits of their increaſe, and all the Tenths, with their Free-will offerings, beſides (even all the beſt of their Oyles, and Wines, and Corn, as God himſelf ſaith (<hi>Numb.</hi> 18.12.) and yet he commanded them to look after ſomthing higher; ſaying (<hi>v.</hi> 20.) I am <hi>thy</hi> part, and <hi>thy</hi> poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion; and commanding the people that they reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence and eſteem them as his Angels (<hi>Mal.</hi> 2.7.) therefore let all Chriſtian people know, that there is due to the Meſſengers of God, maintenance; (<hi>Mat.</hi> 10.10.) and reward, (<hi>Luke</hi> 10.7.) and reverence,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:44083:93"/> as to the Angels of God, yea as to Jeſus Chriſt, (<hi>Gal.</hi> 4.14.) in whoſe name and ſtead they perform the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of Ambaſſadors, (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.20.) O! how happy the Church would be, if we could get back to the times of the Apoſtles!</p>
            <p>Come Lord Jeſus, repair us after thy own good pleaſure: Reſtore to thy Church the Bands of Unity, Reſtore the beauty of Order, Reſtore the reverence of their Government, Reſtore the fervour of thy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; that the Kingdom of God may ſuffer violence, as <hi>of old:</hi> Or if this laſt age be paſt cure, and incorrigible, irreformable, take down the ſtage of the world, that we may enter upon that Bleſſed Kingdom, where ſhall be Unity without Diſtraction; Order without Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; Love without Intermiſſion; and God ſhall be all in all for ever and ever, <hi>Amen.</hi>
